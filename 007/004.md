# [JalaPair.sol] Minting first liquidity with migrator allows the manipulation of Token reserves per LP token

## Summary
**Context:** [JalaPair.sol#L143](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaPair.sol#L143)

```solidity
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            if (IJalaFactory(factory).migrators(msg.sender)) {
                liquidity = IMigrator(msg.sender).desiredLiquidity();
                if (liquidity == 0 || liquidity == type(uint).max) revert BadDesiredLiquidity();
            } else {
                liquidity = Math.sqrt(amount0 * amount1) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
                _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); // permanently lock the first MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY tokens
            }
        } else {
            liquidity = Math.min((amount0 * _totalSupply) / _reserve0, (amount1 * _totalSupply) / _reserve1);
        }
```

## Vulnerability Detail
When minting LP tokens (`addLiquidity`), the amount of LP tokens you are getting is calculated as follows: `liquidity = Math.min((amount0 * _totalSupply) / _reserve0, (amount1 * _totalSupply) / _reserve1);`, if the `_totalSupply` is small enough, and `1 wei` of the LP token worth large amounts of `token0` and `token1`, the user who adds small amounts of liquidity will receive less amount of LP tokens due to precision loss.

A sophisticated attacker can artificially create that scenario by minting only `1 wei` of lp token and adding `1e24` or even larger amounts of `token0` and `token1` by sending the tokens to the contract and then calling sync() to update the reserves.

Then all the new depositors will lose up to `1e24`, letâ€™s say they deposited `1.99e24`, they will only receive `1 wei` of lp token, therefore, losing `0.99e24` of `token0` and `token1`.

## Impact
This attack vector was mitigated in the original version of UniswapV2Pair by having the `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` minted and permanently locked in `address(0)` upon the first mint.

However, adding liquidity with a migrator now can bypass this mitigation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing the migrator if it's not Jala Swap intention to migrate liquidity from others.
