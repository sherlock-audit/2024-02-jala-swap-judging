# Migrator case in JalaPair.sol:mint() lacks `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` burning step

## Summary

Added case of minting liquidity for migrator lacks of burning MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY amount, that could lead to vulnerability explained in Uniswap V2 whitepaper.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaPair.sol#L143

## Vulnerability Detail

As per [Uniswap V2 whitepaper]("https://uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf")

> Uniswap v2 initially mints shares equal to the geometric mean of the amounts deposited ... it is possible for the value of a liquidity pool share to grow over time, either by accumulating trading fees or through “donations” to the liquidity pool. In theory, this could result in a situation where the value of the minimum quantity of liquidity pool shares (1e-18 pool shares) is worth so much that it becomes infeasible for small liquidity providers to provide any liquidity. To mitigate this, Uniswap v2 burns the first 1e-15 (0.000000000000001) pool shares that are minted (1000 times the minimum quantity of pool shares), sending them to the zero address instead of to the minter. This should be a negligible cost for almost any token pair.11 But it dramatically increases the cost of the above attack. In order to raise the value of a liquidity pool share to $100, the attacker would need to donate $100,000 to the pool, which would be permanently locked up as liquidity.

## Impact

Vulnerability become exploitable in the case when liquidity removed by a migrator contract, or in the case of liquidity rebanancing or for other reasons. 
Also if liquidity of this pair removed to migrate to V3 as per developer comment in Discord

> It's to migrate from uni v2 to uni v3 if we ever end up migrating to v3, and migrator contract is not ready yet.

then the generally V2 pools stays deployed and in function (as we saw in the case of Uniswap V2 -> V3 migration), but in the case of JalaSwap this pool becomes empty and vulnerable to said exploit.

## Code Snippet


With the updates in JalaPair.sol, migrator use case was introduced. 

```diff
  if (_totalSupply == 0) {
+           if (IJalaFactory(factory).migrators(msg.sender)) {
+               liquidity = IMigrator(msg.sender).desiredLiquidity();
+               if (liquidity == 0 || liquidity == type(uint256).max) revert BadDesiredLiquidity();
            } else {
                liquidity = Math.sqrt(amount0 * amount1) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
                _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); // permanently lock the first MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY tokens
            }
        } else {
            liquidity = Math.min((amount0 * _totalSupply) / _reserve0, (amount1 * _totalSupply) / _reserve1);
        }
        if (liquidity == 0) revert InsufficientLiquidityMinted();
        _mint(to, liquidity);
```
as we see migrator address will mint `liquidity = IMigrator(msg.sender).desiredLiquidity();` amount and this amount will be  transferred to migrator with `_mint(to, liquidity);` directly bypassing original `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` burning stage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend add a burning step of MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY in the case of migrator. 

```diff
  if (_totalSupply == 0) {
           if (IJalaFactory(factory).migrators(msg.sender)) {
-               liquidity = IMigrator(msg.sender).desiredLiquidity();
+               liquidity = IMigrator(msg.sender).desiredLiquidity() - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
                if (liquidity == 0 || liquidity == type(uint256).max) revert BadDesiredLiquidity();
+              _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); 
            } else {
                liquidity = Math.sqrt(amount0 * amount1) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
                _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); // permanently lock the first MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY tokens
            }
        } else {
            liquidity = Math.min((amount0 * _totalSupply) / _reserve0, (amount1 * _totalSupply) / _reserve1);
        }
        if (liquidity == 0) revert InsufficientLiquidityMinted();
        _mint(to, liquidity);
```
