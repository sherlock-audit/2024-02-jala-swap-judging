# Potential for exploitation due to rounding down in getAmountOut function, which may favor buyers in certain scenarios.

## Summary
Potential for exploitation due to rounding down in `getAmountOut` function, which may favor buyers in certain scenarios.
## Vulnerability Detail

The `getAmountOut` function calculates the amount of output tokens to be received for a given amount of input tokens. Due to Solidity's integer division, the calculation rounds down, which can result in buyers receiving slightly more output tokens than they should, especially when the input amount is very small relative to the reserves.
## Impact
### Scenario
Consider a liquidity pool with the following reserves:
A wrappedToken  -> WT
Base token reserve (reserveIn): 1 WT(1e8 wei)
Fractional token reserve (reserveOut): 100,000,000 (1e8 units)
A user wishes to swap a very small amount of base tokens, say 1 wei of WT, for fractional tokens. The `getAmountOut` function calculates the amount of fractional tokens as follows:

uint256 amountInWithFee = 1 wei * 997 = 997 wei;
uint256 denominator = (1e8 wei * 1000) + amountInWithFee; (1e8 wei *1000) + 997 wei = 100000000997 wei.
uint256 numerator = amountInWithFee * 1e8 units; (997 * 1e8) = 99700000000 wei;
int256 amountOut = numerator / denominator;  99700000000 / 100000000997 = 0.996999990059910099102696311946117769897205834124857833775167397261581049302036938458691723566843516038570145095455

As division in Solidity will round down, the amount results in 0 amount of base tokens required (WT) to buy 0,9 fractional tokens.

 if the user keeps repeating this attack, the fractional token reserve becomes smaller, which will result in a `getAmountOut` amount of >1, after which the tokens will not be free anymore.

## Recommendation
Adjust the rounding policy to ensure that the contract does not give out more assets than intended.
