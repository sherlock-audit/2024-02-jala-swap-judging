# Flash loan users will have to pay fees twice

## Summary

Flash loan fees are added on top of the `amount0Out` and `amount1Out` values, causing the user to be charged the 0.30% trading fee over the existing flash loan fee they are paying.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user requests a flash loan, the implementation will add the flash loan fees to the requested `amount0Out` and `amount1Out` amounts.

```solidity
if (amount0Out > 0) {
    _safeTransfer(
        _token0,
        IJalaFactory(factory).feeTo(),
        (amount0Out * IJalaFactory(factory).flashFee()) / 10000
    );
    amount0Out = (amount0Out * (10000 + IJalaFactory(factory).flashFee())) / 10000;
}
if (amount1Out > 0) {
    _safeTransfer(
        _token1,
        IJalaFactory(factory).feeTo(),
        (amount1Out * IJalaFactory(factory).flashFee()) / 10000
    );
    amount1Out = (amount1Out * (10000 + IJalaFactory(factory).flashFee())) / 10000;
}
```

The intention here is to add these fees to the output amounts so that these are returned and paid by the user.

However, by doing so, the implementation will also add a 0.30% fee on top of the flash loan fee:

```solidity
uint256 balance0Adjusted = (balance0 * 1000) - (amount0In * 3);
uint256 balance1Adjusted = (balance1 * 1000) - (amount1In * 3);
```

This means that the user will have to pay a 0.30% on the original requested amount, the flash loan fee (defined by `flashFee()`) **and also a fee of 0.30% of the flash loan fee**.

## Impact

Users of flash loans will not only have to pay the defined flash loan fee, but also a 0.30% of that amount, incorrectly applying a fee on top of a fee.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Separate the flash loan fee from the amounts that are charged 0.30% so that the user is not charged a fee over the flash loan fee.
