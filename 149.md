# Faulty if statement allows users to drain reserves from pools

## Summary
Since it could be definitely concluded that the codebase is an exact rewrite of the UniswapV2 contracts - and the sponsors confirmed this - there is a line that has been badly rewritten when introducing custom errors because it allows for users to drain the pool from its' liquidity by swapping the entire reserve of one of the tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/ee547b17853e71ed4e0101ccfd52e70d5acded58/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L162

The link above shows how the ```require``` check was written in the UniswapV2 core contracts. When re-written this check in the Jala protocol to introduce custom errors there has been a mistake since the if statement allows for ```amount0Out``` = ```_reserve0``` and also ```amount1Out``` = ```_reserve1``` to be equal.

## Impact
Protocol does not have any reserves since they are swapped out by a user - now it is broken and can not be used by other users hence the HIGH severity tag.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rewrite the if statement to following:
```solidity
if (amount0Out >= _reserve0 || amount1Out >= _reserve1) revert InsufficientLiquidity();
```
