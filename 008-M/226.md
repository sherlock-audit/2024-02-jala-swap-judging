## Summary
Two issues have been identified in the `JalaPair` contract's `swap()` function that could lead to liquidity risks:

1. The `swap()` function permits scenarios where one token's liquidity can be entirely depleted from the pool. This is due to an inadequate conditional check that fails to prevent the liquidity reserves from being completely drained.

2. The function also improperly applies flash loan fees by adjusting the output amounts (`amount0Out`, `amount1Out`) after the initial liquidity reserve check. This can result in the reserves being reduced beyond the intended amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. The `swap()` function's conditional check is not robust enough to prevent the total depletion of a token's liquidity from the pool. It allows transactions where the output amount (`amount0Out` or `amount1Out`) is equal to the token's reserve, which could lead to a state where the pool has zero liquidity for that token.

```solidity
File: contracts/JalaPair.sol
213:   if (amount0Out > _reserve0 || amount1Out > _reserve1) revert InsufficientLiquidity();
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/030d3ed54214754301154bce0e58ea534100a7e3/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaPair.sol#L213

See line 213, the conditional check fails to revert the transaction when the `amountOut` is equal to the `reserve`. This is in contrast to the `UniswapV2Pair` contract, where a similar check on line 162 ensures that the transaction is reverted if the `amountOut` is equal to or exceeds the `reserve`, providing stronger protection against liquidity depletion.

```solidity
162:   require(amount0Out < _reserve0 && amount1Out < _reserve1, 'UniswapV2: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY');
```
https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/ee547b17853e71ed4e0101ccfd52e70d5acded58/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L162

2. The `swap()` function adjusts the output amounts for flash loan fees after performing the liquidity check, which could lead to the reserves being drawn down more than what was accounted for in the initial check. This can cause the reserves to be lower than expected.

```solidity
File: contracts/JalaPair.sol

213:  if (amount0Out > _reserve0 || amount1Out > _reserve1) revert InsufficientLiquidity();
.
.
231:  amount0Out = (amount0Out * (10000 + IJalaFactory(factory).flashFee())) / 10000;
.
.
239:  amount1Out = (amount1Out * (10000 + IJalaFactory(factory).flashFee())) / 10000;
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/030d3ed54214754301154bce0e58ea534100a7e3/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaPair.sol#L231
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/030d3ed54214754301154bce0e58ea534100a7e3/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaPair.sol#L239

Please note that at lines 231 and 239, the `amountOut` values are updated after the liquidity checks have been performed at line 213. This sequence of operations could lead to discrepancies between the checked and actual amounts withdrawn from the reserves.

## Impact
This could effectively disable the pool's ability to facilitate further swaps for the affected token, disrupt market operations, and potentially lead to a loss of the stability and reliability of the liquidity pool. And this issues could disrupt the pricing mechanism of the pool, affect the integrity of transactions, and pose significant financial risks to liquidity providers and users interacting with the pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please move the `InsufficientLiquidity` check after the fee calculation.

```diff
