# incorrect check in `JalaPair#swap()` leads to many bad scenarios to happen

## Summary
this bug exist because of the incorrect check that we have in the swap function inside the `JalaPair.sol` which lead to many harmful things happen/exist like price manipulation, existing of Impermanent loss, drain the pool tokens amount completely , affecting Market Stability.

## Vulnerability Detail
the function swap in `JalaPair.sol` forked from the swap function inside the uniswap pair, this function have a checks that prevent both amount0out and amount1Out to not be equal to the reserve(0,1):

```solidity 
   function swap(uint amount0Out, uint amount1Out, address to, bytes calldata data) external lock {
        require(amount0Out > 0 || amount1Out > 0, 'UniswapV2: INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT');
        (uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1,) = getReserves(); // gas savings
        require(amount0Out < _reserve0 && amount1Out < _reserve1, 'UniswapV2: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY'); // amount out should be below the reserves always.
        
        //.... other lines not important for this report

```

but in the `JalaPair.sol` swap function we have incorrect check which allow amount out to be  below the reserve and `equal` to the reserve amount:

```solidity
 function swap(uint256 amount0Out, uint256 amount1Out, address to, bytes calldata data) external lock {
        if (amount0Out == 0 && amount1Out == 0) revert InsufficientOutputAmount();
        (uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1, ) = getReserves(); // gas savings
        if (amount0Out > _reserve0 || amount1Out > _reserve1) revert InsufficientLiquidity(); //@audit should be >=

```
this open many bad scenarios to happen(e.g : price manipulation, existing of Impermanent loss, drain the pool tokens amount completely , affecting Market Stability) 

## Impact
incorrect checks in the swap functions lead to many bad scenarios to occur and affect all pools.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
change the if check to `>=` instead of  `>`
