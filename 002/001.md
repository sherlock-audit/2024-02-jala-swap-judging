# Functions with permit can be blocked

## Summary

In the `JalaRouter02.sol` contract there are three functions that use `permit` but these functions can be frontrunned and blocked.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `removeLiquidityWithPermit`, `removeLiquidityETHWithPermit`, and `removeLiquidityETHWithPermitSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens` functions internally call `permit()` function from `IJalaPair(pair)`. However, this flow exposes the mentioned functions to a griefing attack, where an attacker can forcibly block the victim's transaction.

Attack scenario: the attacker front-runs the victim's transaction, extracts parameters from the mempool, and places a transaction that directly calls `IJalaPair(pair).permit()` with parameters given by the victim. Consequently, the victim's transaction reverts since parameters have already been used for `permit()` in the attacker's transaction.

## Impact

Griefing,  an attacker can forcibly block the victim's transaction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding `try/cath`, or `if` block, so if the `permit()` is already called, just check the allowance of `msg.sender` and skip the call to `pemit()`:

An example from `The Grapgh`:

```solidity
        IERC20WithPermit token = IERC20WithPermit(address(graphToken));
        // Try permit() before allowance check to advance nonce if possible
        try token.permit(_owner, _spender, _value, _deadline, _v, _r, _s) {
            return;
        } catch Error(string memory reason) {
            // Check for existing allowance before reverting
            if (token.allowance(_owner, _spender) >= _value) {
                return;
            }

            revert(reason);
        }
```
