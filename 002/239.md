# A malicious user can grief and DOS a user while he is trying to remove Liquidity

## Summary

A malicious user can grief and DOS a user while he is trying to remove Liquidity using `removeLiquidityWithPermit()` and `removeLiquidityETHWithPermit()`

## Vulnerability Detail

-The `removeLiquidityWithPermit()` and `removeLiquidityETHWithPermit()` uses permit function to give approve to router contract for the LP tokens and removal of liquidity in the same transaction rather than approving the LP token manually from contract address.

- User signs their LP tokens and provide the signature(v,r,s) to contract as part of approving token using permit.

- When a user calls `removeLiquidityWithPermit` or `removeLiquidityETHWithPermit` function the malicious user see's the transaction in mempool and take the signature of user and calls the permit function himself before the user's transaction gets executed.

- Since the signature provided by malicious user is correct the transaction get's successful and increases the nonce .

- However when user's transaction gets executed it would fail due to increase of nonce .

## Impact

Malicious user can grief and DOS user when he calls removeLiquidityWithPermit() and removeLiquidityETHWithPermit() so whenever the user does the transaction it would get fail and can't remove the liquidity at that particular transaction.

## Recommendation

- Use this code snippet so that it does not throw error even if someone else submits transaction before you.
```solidity
try IERC20Permit(gear).permit(msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}
```
