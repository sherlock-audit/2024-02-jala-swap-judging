# Missing constructor making contract as an abstract

## Summary
The contract "ChilizWrapperFactory.sol" is missing a constructor


## Vulnerability Detail
a missing constructor in the utils/ChilizWrapperFactory.sol making the contract not compiled. Even if we change the version to any version of compiler, it will impose other errors so there is a huge inconsistency in solidity version selection. 

## Impact
the contract is basically responsible for wrapping, unwrapping a tokens. If it wont work , all the functions regarding this wont obviously.
