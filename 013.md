# Initial Liquidity Provider Can Set Extreme Exchange Rate Leading to Denial of Service

## Summary
The vulnerability allows the first liquidity provider (LP) to manipulate the initial price ratio between **tokenA** and **tokenB** by choosing extreme values for **amountADesired** and **amountBDesired** when calling the **addLiquidity** function. Since there are no existing reserves to serve as a reference for the initial rate, the LP can set an arbitrary and possibly economically unfeasible exchange rate. This can deter subsequent LPs from participating in the pool, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition where the pool remains inactive due to the unattractive rates. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Initial Liquidity Provider Can Set Extreme Exchange Rate Leading to Denial of Service" in the provided code is that the **addLiquidity** function allows the initial liquidity provider to set extreme exchange rates by specifying the desired amounts of tokens to be added to the liquidity pool (**amountADesired** and **amountBDesired**) without proper validation.

In lines 63 and 64, the function takes parameters **amountADesired** and **amountBDesired** which represent the desired amounts of **tokenA** and **tokenB** to be added to the liquidity pool. These values are not properly validated against the actual reserves in the pool or market rates, allowing the initial liquidity provider to set extreme values that can manipulate the exchange rate in an unfavorable way.

This can lead to a denial of service scenario where the liquidity provider intentionally sets extreme exchange rates that can disrupt the normal functioning of the liquidity pool and potentially harm other users of the system.

This can be exploited by manipulating the amount of tokens provided in the addLiquidity function to skew the exchange rate in their favor.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) :**

1. Deploy a smart contract that interacts with the addLiquidity function of the vulnerable contract.
2. Provide a large amount of one token (tokenA) and a small amount of the other token (tokenB) in the addLiquidity function.
3. By doing so, the liquidity provider can set an extreme exchange rate that benefits them greatly.
4. This can lead to a denial of service for other users who interact with the pair, as the exchange rate is manipulated in favor of the initial liquidity provider.

By exploiting this vulnerability, the initial liquidity provider can gain an unfair advantage and potentially disrupt the normal functioning of the pair for other users.

## Impact
The root cause is the lack of validation for the initial price ratio, and the maximum achievable impact is the potential for a single LP to prevent the pool from functioning properly, thereby disrupting the market mechanism of the decentralized exchange.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One way to fix this issue is to implement a check in the addLiquidity function to ensure that the exchange rate between the two tokens falls within a reasonable range. This can be done by setting a maximum ratio between the two amounts of tokens that can be provided in the addLiquidity function.

Here is an example of a patch code that includes this check:

```solidity
function addLiquidity(
    address tokenA,
    address tokenB,
    uint256 amountADesired,
    uint256 amountBDesired,
    uint256 amountAMin,
    uint256 amountBMin,
    address to,
    uint256 deadline
) external virtual override ensure(deadline) returns (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB, uint256 liquidity) {
    require(amountADesired > 0 && amountBDesired > 0, "Cannot add 0 liquidity");
    
    (amountA, amountB) = _addLiquidity(tokenA, tokenB, amountADesired, amountBDesired, amountAMin, amountBMin);
    
    // Check if the exchange rate is within a reasonable range
    require(amountA.mul(1000).div(amountB) <= 1100 && amountA.mul(1000).div(amountB) >= 900, "Exchange rate must be within 10% of the current rate");
    
    address pair = JalaLibrary.pairFor(factory, tokenA, tokenB);
    TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(tokenA, msg.sender, pair, amountA);
    TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(tokenB, msg.sender, pair, amountB);
    liquidity = IJalaPair(pair).mint(to);
}
```
n this patch code, we added a **require** statement to check if the exchange rate between the two tokens falls within a reasonable range (in this case, within 10% of the current rate). This helps prevent the initial liquidity provider from setting an extreme exchange rate that could lead to a denial of service attack.
