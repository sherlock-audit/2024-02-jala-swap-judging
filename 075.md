# M-3 Critical Address changes can be a 2-step process

## Summary
Currently, the critical address which serves as  `feeToSetter` is changed in a single step process.
If the value set is mistakenly invalid that the protocol does not want, then the protocol can be misused or left useless


## Vulnerability Detail
The Jalaswap factory contains critical addreses `feeToSetter` which can set fee receiver , flashFee and Migrators
so changing it in one function call according to current structure is risky because following situations can happen:

- setting mistakenly a zero address as feeToSetter
- setting mistakenly an invalid address
- feeToSetter losing his privateKey ( quite common these days )

in either case, the entire protocol can be hijacked by various means or at the least , it will deem uncontrolled which is not something we want.

Senior Watson **0xRajeev** has found a similar issue in the past and here's how he put it:

```markdown
...
The contracts allow for uberOwners to be changed to a different address from the contract owner/deployer
using the changeUberOwner() function which is callable by the current uberOwner.
While this function checks for zero-address, there is no validation of the new address being correct. 

If the current uberOwner incorrectly uses an invalid address for which they do not have the private key, 

then the system gets locked because the uberOwner cannot be corrected and none of the other functions that require uberOwner caller can be executed.

Impact 

The current uberOwner uses a non-zero but incorrect address as the new uberOwner. 
This gets set and now the system is locked and none of the uberOwner-only callable functions are callable.
This error cannot be fixed either and will require redeployment of contracts which will mean that
all existing markets have to be terminated. 
The system will have to be shut and restarted completely from scratch which will take a reputation hit
and have a serious technical and business impact.
```

## Impact
Loss of protocol control or loss of funds for users ( if the attacker comes up with idea of exploiting this issue )

```solidity

   function setFeeTo(address _feeTo) external onlyFeeToSetter {
        feeTo = _feeTo;
        emit SetFeeTo(feeTo);
    }

    function setFeeToSetter(address _feeToSetter) external onlyFeeToSetter {
        address oldFeeToSetter = feeToSetter;
        feeToSetter = _feeToSetter;
        emit SetFeeToSetter(oldFeeToSetter, _feeToSetter);
    }

    function setMigrator(address _migrator, bool _state) external onlyFeeToSetter {
        migrators[_migrator] = _state;
        emit SetMigrator(_migrator, _state);
    }

    function setFlashOn(bool _flashOn) external onlyFeeToSetter {
        flashOn = _flashOn;
        emit SetFlashOn(_flashOn);
    }

    function setFlashFee(uint _flashFee) external onlyFeeToSetter {
        flashFee = _flashFee;
        emit SetFlashFee(_flashFee);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use 2step ownership transfer method for example the one provided by open zeppelin or creating your own 2-step ownership transfer solution where we first add the pending owner and then confirm the actual new owner
