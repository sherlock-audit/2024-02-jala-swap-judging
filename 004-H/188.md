# user losses there funds due to forgotten calculation

## Summary
the function **swapExactTokensForETH**  in jalaMasterRouter  doesn't convert the  amountin into the wrapped decimal value which will cause to only swap a small amount 
## Vulnerability Detail
 the function **swapExactTokensForETH** in **jalaMasterRouter** forgets to  wrap the amountin variable into the wrapped token decimal    and tries to call the  router  **swapExactTokensForETH** with the default amount **amountIn** so in this case the router will only swap  a small amount than the intended because since the wrappederc20 is 18 decimal and the collateral is less than 18 we are trying to swap a small amount  we should have first convert the **amounIn** with the `IChilizWrappedERC20(wrappedTokenOut).getDecimalsOffset();` so that  the **amounIn** will also be wrapped  due to this a user  loses the remaining amount in our case `(amountIn * IChilizWrappedERC20(wrappedTokenOut).getDecimalsOffset(); - amountIn`)
## Impact 
loss of fund

## Recommendation
convert the amounIn  into the wrapped token decimal like this `(amountIn * IChilizWrappedERC20(wrappedTokenOut).getDecimalsOffset()`
