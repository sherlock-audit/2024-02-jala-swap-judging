# Precision Loss can Lead to Permanent lock of User funds

## Summary
Divisions in EVM are rounded down, which means when the fraction price is close to 1 (e.g. 0.999) it would effectively be zero, when it's close to 2 (1.999) it would be rounded to 1.

## Vulnerability Detail
The minimum a user can withdraw is the `decimalOffset`  of the `ChilizWrappedERC20` token as anything below it would automatically be rounded down to zero.

### Poc

For instance lets assume a token `TEST` with an underlying decimal of 6.  

the decimalOffset would be 10^ 12. == 10,000,000,000,000

user A decides to deposit 10 tokens  of `TEST` he would be minted 100_000_000_000_000  `ChilizWrappedERC20` number of tokens.

Ideally when trying to Withdraw . the amount would be divided by decimalOffset. 

If user sends 99_800_000_000_000 tokens to another address he is left with 200_000_000_000 worth of `ChilizWrappedERC20`.  which is more than 9.8 `TEST` token worth.

This amount would not be withrawable as 200_000_000_000 / decimalOffset would be rounded down to zero. 

Even if the user decides to purchase another 10 tokens worth. he would not be able to withdraw all his balance because of the automatic rounding down by solidity. 

## Impact

User funds can be permanently stucked on protocol
