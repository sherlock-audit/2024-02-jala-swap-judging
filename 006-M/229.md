# Loss of precission when unwrapping small amounts of tokens

## Summary
In the `ChilizWrappedERC20` when calculating the amount to `unwrap` in the `withdrawTo` function dividing by the `decimalOffset` and then multiplying the resulting amount by the `decimalOffset` will cause small amounts of tokens to get stuck in the contract and won't allow a user to unwrap these amounts.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/utils/ChilizWrappedERC20.sol#L45

## Vulnerability Detail
The following proof of concept wraps 100 wei of tokenA which in this example is a token with 3 decimals leaving the `tokenOffset` to be `10 ** 15`.

You can see below how the `ChilizWrappedERC20` contract calculates the `tokenOffset`. This is the first part of the problem. Due to this strange calculation it will divided the `amount` to unwrap by a number which is `10 **15` and is much larger then the actual decimals being passed for the underlying token.

```solidity
        if (msg.sender != factory) revert Forbidden();
        if (_underlyingToken.decimals() >= 18) revert InvalidDecimals();
        if (address(underlyingToken) != address(0)) revert AlreadyExists();

        underlyingToken = _underlyingToken;
        decimalsOffset = 10 ** (18 - _underlyingToken.decimals());
        name = string(abi.encodePacked("Wrapped ", _underlyingToken.name()));
        symbol = string(abi.encodePacked("W", _underlyingToken.symbol()));
    }
```
Below we can see a POC which attempts to wrap 100 tokens and then unwrap it except when unwrapping due to rounding errors it will round down to zero and the `CannotWithdraw()` error will be thrown.

```solidity
tokenA = new ERC20Mintable("Token A", "TKNA", 3);

 function test_WrapAndUnwrapToken() public{
        tokenA.approve(address(wrapperFactory), type(uint256).max);
        wrapperFactory.wrap(address(this), address(tokenA), 100);
        address wrappedTokenA = wrapperFactory.wrappedTokenFor(address(tokenA));
        uint decimals = tokenA.decimals();
        console.log("decimals", decimals);
        IERC20(wrappedTokenA).approve(address(wrapperFactory), 100);
        wrapperFactory.unwrap(address(this), wrappedTokenA, 100);
     
    }
```
Below are the results from running the POC with a small amount of wei.
```solidity
Ran 1 test suite in 1.24s (2.59ms CPU time): 0 tests passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)

Failing tests:
Encountered 1 failing test in test/JalaMasterRouter.t.sol:JalaMasterRouter_Test
[FAIL. Reason: CannotWithdraw()] test_WrapAndUnwrapToken() (gas: 1938038)
```
## Impact
Tokens with small decimals greater than zero or small token amounts will get stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet
You can see in the code snippet below where dividing by `tokenOffset` first will cause the value of amount to round down if it is less then the `tokenOffset` being used.

```solidity
    function withdrawTo(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
        if (address(underlyingToken) == address(0)) revert NotInitialized();
        uint256 unwrapAmount = amount / decimalsOffset;
        if (unwrapAmount == 0) revert CannotWithdraw();
        address msgSender = _msgSender();
        uint256 burntAmount = unwrapAmount * decimalsOffset;
        _burn(msgSender, burntAmount);
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(underlyingToken, account, unwrapAmount);
        if (msgSender != account) {
            _transfer(msgSender, account, amount - burntAmount);
        }

        emit Withdraw(account, amount);

        return true;
    }
 ```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `withdrawTo` function is overly complex and could be simplified or rewritten to avoid this type of issue. Below is a fix that multiples before dividing which allows the user to be able to withdraw even small amounts of wrapped tokens.

```solidity
 function withdrawTo(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
        if (address(underlyingToken) == address(0)) revert NotInitialized();
        uint256 unwrapAmount = amount * decimalsOffset;
        if (unwrapAmount == 0) revert CannotWithdraw();
        address msgSender = _msgSender();
        uint256 burntAmount = unwrapAmount / decimalsOffset;
        _burn(msgSender, burntAmount);
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(underlyingToken, account, amount);
        if (msgSender != account) {
            _transfer(msgSender, account, amount - burntAmount);
        }

        emit Withdraw(account, amount);

        return true;
    }
 ```
Alternatively you could use `solmate` or `solady` fixedpoint libraries to better handle decimals and rounding errors. Using wad for greater precision could help avoid these issues as well.
