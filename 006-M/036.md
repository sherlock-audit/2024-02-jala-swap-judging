# Inadequate Handling of Locked Funds Leading to Incorrect Loss Calculation and User Asset Loss

## Summary
The **withdrawTo** function exhibits a critical vulnerability due to the lack of validation between the burnt shares (**burntAmount**) and the actual value transferred (**unwrapAmount**). If the **underlyingToken** is subject to locking or freezing, users may receive less value than they withdraw, causing an inaccurate representation of their remaining shares and potential financial loss, which could lead to protocol insolvency.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability in this code is that the function **withdrawTo** does not properly handle the calculation of the amount to be transferred and the amount to be burnt.

On line 47, the code calculates **unwrapAmount** by dividing the input amount by **decimalsOffset**. Then on line 50, it calculates **burntAmount** by multiplying **unwrapAmount** by **decimalsOffset**. However, due to the way integer division works in Solidity, there is a possibility of loss of precision in these calculations.

If the input amount is not evenly divisible by **decimalsOffset**, the division on line 47 will truncate the remainder, leading to an incorrect calculation of **unwrapAmount**. This incorrect calculation will then result in an incorrect calculation of **burntAmount** on line 50.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can call the withdrawTo function with a specific amount value that triggers the incorrect calculation of burntAmount. By manipulating the amount value, the attacker can withdraw more tokens than intended, resulting in a loss of user assets.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MaliciousToken is ERC20 {
    uint256 public decimalsOffset;

    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol, uint256 _decimalsOffset) ERC20(name, symbol) {
        decimalsOffset = _decimalsOffset;
    }

    function maliciousWithdrawTo(address contractAddress, uint256 amount) public {
        uint256 unwrapAmount = amount / decimalsOffset;
        uint256 burntAmount = unwrapAmount * decimalsOffset; // Incorrect calculation
        _transfer(msg.sender, contractAddress, amount - burntAmount);
    }
}
```
In the PoC code above, the **maliciousWithdrawTo** function is designed to exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the amount value to trigger the incorrect calculation of **burntAmount**. This can result in the loss of user assets when tokens are transferred to the **contractAddress**.

It is essential to fix this vulnerability by ensuring the correct calculation of **burntAmount** in the **withdrawTo** function to prevent potential loss of user assets.

## Impact
As a result, the user may end up losing more tokens than intended when calling this function, leading to a loss of assets for the user. This is a classic example of inadequate handling of locked funds, where the contract fails to properly account for the precision of calculations involving user funds, leading to potential loss of assets.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the **burntAmount** is calculated correctly based on the amount parameter passed to the **withdrawTo** function. One way to do this is to calculate the **burntAmount** as **amount - unwrapAmount,** which ensures that the correct amount is burnt and transferred to the user.

Here is the patched code example:
```solidity
45       function withdrawTo(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
46           if (address(underlyingToken) == address(0)) revert NotInitialized();
47           uint256 unwrapAmount = amount / decimalsOffset;
48           if (unwrapAmount == 0) revert CannotWithdraw();
49           address msgSender = _msgSender();
50           uint256 burntAmount = amount - unwrapAmount;
51           _burn(msgSender, burntAmount);
52           SafeERC20.safeTransfer(underlyingToken, account, unwrapAmount);
53           if (msgSender != account) {
54               _transfer(msgSender, account, amount - burntAmount);
55           }
56   
57           emit Withdraw(account, amount);
58   
59           return true;
60       }
```
In this patched code, the **burntAmount** is calculated as **amount - unwrapAmount**, at line 50ensuring that the correct amount is burnt and transferred to the user. This fix addresses the vulnerability by handling locked funds correctly and preventing incorrect loss calculation and user asset loss.
