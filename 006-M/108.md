# Token Loss Due to Precision Error in ChilizWrapperFactory Contract

## Summary

The loss of tokens can occur due to precision loss when interacting with the CHILLsWrapperFactory contract. The contract includes functions for depositing and withdrawing tokens, intended to wrap and unwrap tokens for users. If a user wraps a token with 12 decimals, there may be some precision loss if they deposit a large amount and attempt to withdraw the same amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability lies in the ChilizWrapperFactory::unwrap function, which calls the ChilzwrapperERC20::withdrawTo function. This function involves division by the decimal offset:
 [ChilizWrapperFactory::unwrap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/utils/ChilizWrapperFactory.sol#L15-L27)
[ChilzwrapperERC20::withdrawTo](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/utils/ChilizWrappedERC20.sol#L45-L60)

```solidity
   function withdrawTo(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
        if (address(underlyingToken) == address(0)) revert NotInitialized();
        uint256 unwrapAmount = amount / decimalsOffset;
        if (unwrapAmount == 0) revert CannotWithdraw();
        address msgSender = _msgSender();
        uint256 burntAmount = unwrapAmount * decimalsOffset;
        _burn(msgSender, burntAmount);
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(underlyingToken, account, unwrapAmount);
        if (msgSender != account) {
            _transfer(msgSender, account, amount - burntAmount);
        }

        emit Withdraw(account, amount);

        return true;
    }
```

This division by the decimal offset can lead to precision loss, especially if the contract interacts with a token with 12 decimals, resulting in a decimal offset of 6.

If a user deposits a large amount of tokens and then attempts to withdraw the same amount, precision loss occurs, and the user may not receive the desired amount of tokens.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is significant token loss for users. For instance, if Alice deposits a substantial amount of tokens and immediately attempts to withdraw the same amount, she may end up receiving less than her initial deposit due to precision loss.

Let's consider an example:

- Alice deposits a large amount, say 137353957322134, through the ChilizWrapperFactory::wrap function.
- Immediately afterward, she attempts to withdraw the same amount using the ChilizWrapperFactory::unwrap functionality.
- However, due to the calculation in the withdraw function (uint256 unwrapAmount = amount / decimalsOffset;), where the - - - - offset is 6 decimals, Alice receives a lesser amount than her initial deposit.

Calculating the unwrapAmount:

```solidity
amount = 137353957322134
decimalsOffset = 1000000

unwrapAmount = 137353957322134 / 1000000

unwrapAmount = 137353957
```

Thus, Alice incurs a loss of `137353957322134 - 137353957 = 137353819968177` tokens, simply by interacting with the wrapper contract.

Thank you for providing the code snippet. Here it is included in the vulnerability report:

## Code Snippet

To test the vulnerability and its impact, you can deploy a contract with 12 decimals or include the following code in the test file:

```solidity
contract TestERC20 is ERC20 {
  constructor() ERC20() {
    name = "Test";
    symbol = "TST";
  }

  function mint(uint256 amount) public {
    _mint(msg.sender, amount);
  }

  function decimals() public view virtual override returns (uint8) {
    return 12;
  }
}
```

In the setup phase, add the following:

```solidity
shaddyTokenA = new TestERC20();

vm.startPrank(user0);
shaddyTokenA.mint(100 ether);
vm.stopPrank();
```

Then, add the following test case to the file:

```solidity
function test_Loss() public /*uint128 _amt*/ {
  // vm.assume(_amt == 137353957322134);
  vm.startPrank(user0);
  // shaddy token address with 12 decimals
  address wrappedTokenA = IChilizWrapperFactory(wrapperFactory).wrappedTokenFor(address(shaddyTokenA));

  uint256 amount = 100000;
  uint256 wrappedAmount = 100000 * 1e18;

  // create shaddy token wrapper  (offset will be 1e6)
  // 10 ** (18 - 12) = 10 ** 6 = 1000000;

  address tokenReturned = wrapperFactory.createWrappedToken(address(shaddyTokenA));
  // get balance before any interaction
  uint shaddyBalanceBefore = shaddyTokenA.balanceOf(user0);
  console.log(shaddyBalanceBefore);

  // start interaction with ChilizWrapperFactory
  shaddyTokenA.approve(address(wrapperFactory), type(uint200).max);

  wrapperFactory.wrap(user0, address(shaddyTokenA), 137353957322134);
  IERC20(wrappedTokenA).approve(address(router), wrappedAmount);

  uint offset = IChilizWrappedERC20(tokenReturned).getDecimalsOffset();
  console.log(offset);

  IERC20 underlying = IChilizWrappedERC20(tokenReturned).underlying();

  // begin unwrap

  IERC20(address(tokenReturned)).approve(address(wrapperFactory), type(uint200).max);
  wrapperFactory.unwrap(user0, tokenReturned, 137353957322134);

  uint shaddyBalanceAfter = shaddyTokenA.balanceOf(user0);
  console.log(shaddyBalanceAfter);

  console.logUint(shaddyBalanceBefore - shaddyBalanceAfter);

  assertGt(shaddyBalanceBefore, shaddyBalanceAfter);
}
```

You can run the test using `forge t --mt test_Loss -vvvvv`. This test case will help verify the vulnerability and its impact.

## Tool used

Manual Review & Foundry

## Recommendation

Implement a modification in the contract to multiply the decimalOffset by a large amount and divide afterward to maintain precision.
