# `JalaPair::swap` function can send flash fee to not valid address and thus lose tokens forever

## Summary
`JalaPair::swap` can send flash fees to the default, not valid address `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`, because there are no checks for  `feeTo` address in the function

## Vulnerability Detail
By default `JalaFactory` contract sets `feeTo` address to `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD` value, which is not valid address. `feeToSetter` can switch on flash fees and set feeTo address only in different transactions. So there is a possibility, that between switching flash fee on in one transaction and setting fee receiver in another one, someone can call `swap` and pay flash fee to the dead address. 

Also, `feeToSetter` can forget to set a valid `feeTo` address or manipulate with it. 

## Impact
Traders can pay flash fees to not valid address and thus lose tokens

    (amount0Out * IJalaFactory(factory).flashFee()) / 10000
);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an extra check before sending flash fees on whether the `feeTo` is not equal to `DEAD` adderss:

```diff
address public constant DEAD = 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD;
...
- if (IJalaFactory(factory).flashOn() && data.length > 0) {
+ if (IJalaFactory(factory).flashOn() && data.length > 0 && IJalaFactory(factory).feeTo() != DEAD) {
    if (amount0Out > 0) {
        _safeTransfer(
            _token0,
            IJalaFactory(factory).feeTo(),
            (amount0Out * IJalaFactory(factory).flashFee()) / 10000
        );
        amount0Out = (amount0Out * (10000 + IJalaFactory(factory).flashFee())) / 10000;
    }
...
```
