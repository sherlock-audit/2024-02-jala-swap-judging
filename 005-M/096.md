# M-7 Incorrect Minting Fee check can cause loss of funds to users

## Summary
The protocol's intention at the start of deploying the `JalaFactory` seems to allow minting without fees and once the feeTo variable is set to some valid address, the protocol will start charging the fee to them.

However, in its current implementation, the protocol does not allow fee-less minting because of incorrect configuration.

## Vulnerability Detail
Initially when deploying the factory , the `constructor` is setting the `feeTo` variable to `DEAD` address which is used to burn the ether sent to the address. 
Now in `_mintFee` function, there is onFee check as follows

```solidity
  // if fee is on, mint liquidity equivalent to 1/2th of the growth in sqrt(k)
    function _mintFee(uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1) private returns (bool feeOn) {
        address feeTo = IJalaFactory(factory).feeTo(); // get feeTo address
        feeOn = feeTo != address(0);
        uint256 _kLast = kLast; // gas savings
        if (feeOn) {
            if (_kLast != 0) {
                uint256 rootK = Math.sqrt(uint256(_reserve0) * _reserve1);
                uint256 rootKLast = Math.sqrt(_kLast);
                if (rootK > rootKLast) {
                    uint256 numerator = totalSupply * (rootK - rootKLast);
                    uint256 denominator = rootK + rootKLast;
                    uint256 liquidity = numerator / denominator;
                    // distribute LP fee
                    if (liquidity > 0) _mint(feeTo, liquidity);
                }
            }
        } else if (_kLast != 0) {
            kLast = 0;
        }
    }

```
The JalaPair expects the `feeTo` address to be non-zero to have no fee. But the intention of setting the feeTo variable in JalaFactory's Constructor seems to intend the no-fee by specifying it as DEAD address.

And having a non-zero address other than a DEAD address to impose mint fees.

However, in the current implementation, it is checking the feeTo variable to be equal to zero address.

If the protocol intends to have DEAD address to specify no mint fee then the current logic will cause loss of funds to the user
because they will pay the mint fee even if it was disabled by factory.

## Impact

Loss of funds to Users who are minting in JalaPair

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaPair.sol#L110-L118

```solidity
    address feeTo = IJalaFactory(factory).feeTo(); // get feeTo address
        feeOn = feeTo != address(0);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change 

```solidity
 feeOn = feeTo != address(0);
``` 

to 

```solidity 
feeOn = feeTo != address(0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD);

```
or if protocol also wants to keep the zero address check, they can add the OR

```solidity

 feeOn = (   (feeTo != address(0) )  || ( feeTo != address(0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD)  ) );

```
