# Potential Issuance of Unbacked Wrapped Tokens Due to Insecure ERC20 Transfer Handling

## Summary
The wrap function is vulnerable due to the potential improper handling of ERC20 token transfer return values by _transferTokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Potential Issuance of Unbacked Wrapped Tokens Due to Insecure ERC20 Transfer Handling" in the provided code is that the _transferTokens function on line 20 does not handle the possibility of a failed transfer of the underlying token. If the transfer of the underlying token fails, the wrapped token will still be issued to the user on line 21, even though the corresponding amount of underlying tokens was not successfully transferred.

The vulnerability in the code lies in the _transferTokens function call on line 20. If the **underlyingToken** being transferred is a malicious ERC20 token that does not properly handle the transfer logic, it could potentially exploit this function to mint unbacked wrapped tokens.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**

1. Deploy a malicious ERC20 token contract that does not properly deduct the transferred amount from the sender's balance.
2. Call the **wrap** function with the address of the malicious ERC20 token as the **underlyingToken** parameter and a large amount.
3. The **_transferTokens** function will transfer the amount of the malicious ERC20 token to the **wrappedToken** address without properly deducting it from the sender's balance.
4. As a result, the **wrappedToken** contract will mint wrapped tokens to the account without the corresponding underlying tokens being properly backed.

This exploit could lead to the issuance of unbacked wrapped tokens, causing a loss of value and trust in the system.

## Impact
This can lead to the issuance of wrapped tokens without a corresponding transfer of underlying tokens, risking protocol insolvency and the creation of unbacked wrapped tokens, which undermines the integrity of the token wrapping mechanism and the overall security of the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, we need to add a check to ensure that the token transfer is successful before proceeding with the deposit. If the transfer fails, the wrap function should revert the transaction to prevent the issuance of unbacked wrapped tokens.

Here is the patched code example:

```solidity
15       function wrap(address account, address underlyingToken, uint256 amount) public returns (address wrappedToken) {
16           wrappedToken = underlyingToWrapped[underlyingToken];
17           if (wrappedToken == address(0)) {
18               wrappedToken = _createWrappedToken(underlyingToken);
19           }
20           require(_transferTokens(IERC20(underlyingToken), wrappedToken, amount), "Token transfer failed");
21           IChilizWrappedERC20(wrappedToken).depositFor(account, amount);
22       }
```
By adding the require statement on line 20, the function will revert if the token transfer fails, preventing the issuance of unbacked wrapped tokens.
