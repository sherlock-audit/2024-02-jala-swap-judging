# NC-3: Unused Ownership

## Summary
ChilizWrapperFactory contract is ownable, but the ownership functionalities are never used.

## Vulnerability Detail
None of the functions or modifiers from the `Ownable` contract are used in the `ChilizWrapperFactory` contract. This inclusion results in unnecessary code that does not contribute to the contract's functionality.

## Code Snippet
- Found in contracts/utils/ChilizWrapperFactory.sol [Line: 11](contracts/utils/ChilizWrapperFactory.sol#L11)

	```solidity
	contract ChilizWrapperFactory is IChilizWrapperFactory, Ownable {
	```
