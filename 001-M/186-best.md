# JalaPair potential permanent DoS due to overflow

## Summary

In the `JalaPair::_update` function, overflow is intentionally desired in the calculations for `timeElapsed` and `priceCumulative`. This is forked from the UniswapV2 source code, and itâ€™s meant and known to overflow. UniswapV2 was developed using Solidity 0.6.6, where arithmetic operations overflow and underflow by default. However, Jala utilizes Solidity >=0.8.0, where such operations will automatically revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
    // * never overflows, and + overflow is desired
    price0CumulativeLast += uint256(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve1).uqdiv(_reserve0)) * timeElapsed;
    price1CumulativeLast += uint256(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve0).uqdiv(_reserve1)) * timeElapsed;
}
```

## Impact

This issue could potentially lead to permanent denial of service for a pool. All the core functionalities such as `mint`, `burn`, or `swap` would be broken. Consequently, all funds would be locked within the contract.

I think issue with High impact and a Low probability (merely due to the extended timeframe for the event's occurrence, it's important to note that this event will occur with 100% probability if the protocol exists at that time), should be considered at least as Medium.

There are cases where the same issue is considered High.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the `unchecked` block to ensure everything overflows as expected
