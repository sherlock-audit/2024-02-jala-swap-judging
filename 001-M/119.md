# Functions depending on `_update` might not work due to overflow protection

## Summary
The JalaPair's `_update` function is vulnerable to reversion upon overflow due to not being wrapped in an unchecked block and the contract being compiled with solidity ^0.8.0

## Vulnerability Detail

The JalaPair contract is a direct fork of UniswapV2Pair contract, hence it takes most of v2's properties. A major difference in the contracts is the solidity version in use, ^0.8.0 in JalaPair and [0.5.16](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/ee547b17853e71ed4e0101ccfd52e70d5acded58/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L1C18-L1C24) in UniswapV2Pair. This poses an issue in the `_update` function which desires overflow, just like in Uniswap, but will not be able to achieve overflow because solidity versions >= 0.8.0 revert on overflow. 

## Impact

If this happens all the core functionalities of the contract would break, including `mint()`, `burn()`, `sync()` and `swap()`. Other functions that depend on the functions in the contract would be significantly affected, e.g `addLiquidity`, `removeLiquidity` in the JalaRouter02 contract and so on.

```solidity

    function _update(uint256 balance0, uint256 balance1, uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1) private {
        if (balance0 > type(uint112).max || balance1 > type(uint112).max) revert Overflow();
        uint32 blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp % 2 ** 32);
        uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
            // * never overflows, and + overflow is desired
            price0CumulativeLast += uint256(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve1).uqdiv(_reserve0)) * timeElapsed;
            price1CumulativeLast += uint256(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve0).uqdiv(_reserve1)) * timeElapsed;
        }
        reserve0 = uint112(balance0);
        reserve1 = uint112(balance1);
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Wrap the function in an unchecked{} block so that when the variable overflows it loops back to 0 instead of reverting.
