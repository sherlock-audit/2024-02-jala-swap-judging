# JalaPair.sol#_update() - Calculations for `price0CumulativeLast` and `price1CumulativeLast` are meant to overflow, but cannot

## Summary
Calculations for `price0CumulativeLast` and `price1CumulativeLast` are meant to overflow, but cannot

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract and other parts of the protocol are a fork of UniV2 and inherit all of UniV2's quirks.
One of these quirks is that some parts of the code are meant to and designed around overflowing/underflowing.

`_update` is where one of these quirks occur.

```solidity
function _update(uint256 balance0, uint256 balance1, uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1) private {
        if (balance0 > type(uint112).max || balance1 > type(uint112).max) revert Overflow();
        uint32 blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp % 2 ** 32);
        uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
            // * never overflows, and + overflow is desired
            price0CumulativeLast += uint256(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve1).uqdiv(_reserve0)) * timeElapsed;
            price1CumulativeLast += uint256(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve0).uqdiv(_reserve1)) * timeElapsed;
        }
        reserve0 = uint112(balance0);
        reserve1 = uint112(balance1);
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }
```

You can see that even the code above `price0CumulativeLast and price1CumulativeLast` state.
>  // * never overflows, and + overflow is desired

This means that the addition part of the equation is meant to overflow.

In the original UniV2 code this is possible because UniV2 uses Solidity version 0.5.16, but in JalaSwap's case the overflow will panic revert, as the protocol uses Solidity 0.8.0.

## Impact
DoS of the `_update` function, which will freeze funds.

## Recommendation
Wrapped the code in an unchecked block.
