# M-4 JalaERC20 is prone to Front-running and Approve Race Condition

## Summary
JalaERC20 is prone to Front-running and Approve Race Condition
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract of the FETH does not have any protection against the well-known “Multiple Withdrawal Attack” attack on the Approve/TransferFrom methods of the ERC20 standard.

Although we have increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance functions in JalaERC20 but the problem arises when the `approve` method is `declared as external`. Because `Not ALL users are aware of APPROVE RACE Condition` , this implementation will set the funds of users at risk due to which users might lose funds.

Although this attack poses a limited risk in specific situations, it is worth mentioning to consider it for possible future operations.

## Impact
Loss of funds for users by front-running

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/tokens/JalaERC20.sol#L50

```solidity

    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool) {
        _approve(msg.sender, spender, value);
        return true;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only use increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance for approvals
