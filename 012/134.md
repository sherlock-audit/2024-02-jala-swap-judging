# Incorrect Application of Trading Fee

## Summary

The `JalaLibrary`'s `getAmountOut` and `getAmountIn` functions do not consistently apply the trading fee, leading to potential discrepancies in asset exchange calculations within the DeFi protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `getAmountOut` function applies a `0.3%` trading fee correctly by adjusting the input amount before calculating the output amount. However, the `getAmountIn` function does not properly reverse this fee calculation when determining the required input amount for a desired output amount. This is not actually a `0.3%` fee. This inconsistency can result in users paying more than expected due to the improper fee application in the reverse calculation. Moreover, due to the nature of integer division in Solidity, transactions involving small amounts can end up with the fee having no discernible impact, essentially equating the fee-applied calculations with those where no fee is considered.

**Numerical Example:**

Consider the following transaction amounts:

- `amountIn = 100`
- `reserveIn = 1000`
- `reserveOut = 2000`

**Calculations are performed with and without the supposed 0.3% fee** to illustrate the minimal impact on small transaction amounts.

**With the supposed 0.3% fee:**
The calculation yields an `amountOut` of approximately `181.32`, using the following adjusted formula to account for the fee:

```solidity
uint256 amountInWithFee = amountIn * 997;
uint256 denominator = (reserveIn * 1000) + amountInWithFee;
uint256 numerator = amountInWithFee * reserveOut;
uint256 amountOut = numerator / denominator;
```

**Without any fee applied:**
By not applying the fee, the calculation similarly yields an `amountOut` of approximately `181.82`, demonstrating the negligible difference:

```solidity
uint256 amountInWithFee = amountIn * 1000; // No fee adjustment
uint256 denominator = (reserveIn * 1000) + amountInWithFee;
uint256 numerator = amountInWithFee * reserveOut;
uint256 amountOut = numerator / denominator;
```

This example demonstrates that for small amounts, the effect of the 0.3% fee can be virtually indistinguishable from scenarios where no fee is applied, due to the rounding down effect in integer division.

## Impact

The primary impact of the observed fee application behavior is that the protocol collects less in fees than intended. The expectation of a `0.3%` trading fee is not met in practice for these transactions due to the way the fee is calculated and applied. This discrepancy arises from the use of integer division and the proportional scaling of the fee.

## Recommendation

Change the `getAmountOut` and `getAmountIn` functions in the following way:

```diff
    function getAmountOut(
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 reserveIn,
        uint256 reserveOut
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        if (amountIn == 0) revert InsufficientInputAmount();
        if (reserveIn == 0 || reserveOut == 0) revert InsufficientLiquidity();
--     uint256 amountInWithFee = amountIn * 997;
--     uint256 denominator = (reserveIn * 1000) + amountInWithFee;
++    uint256 amountInWithFee = (amountIn * 997) / 1000;
++    uint256 denominator = reserveIn  + amountInWithFee;
        uint256 numerator = amountInWithFee * reserveOut;
        amountOut = numerator / denominator;
    }

    function getAmountIn(
        uint256 amountOut,
        uint256 reserveIn,
        uint256 reserveOut
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 amountIn) {
        if (amountOut == 0) revert InsufficientOutputAmount();
        if (reserveIn == 0 || reserveOut == 0) revert InsufficientLiquidity();
--     uint256 numerator = reserveIn * amountOut * 1000;
--     uint256 denominator = (reserveOut - amountOut) * 997;
++    uint256 numerator = reserveIn * amountOut ;
++    uint256 denominator = ((reserveOut - amountOut) * 997) / 1000);
        amountIn = (numerator / denominator) + 1;
    }
```
