# Code Injection Via Token Name

## Summary
Code Injection Via Token Name

## Vulnerability Detail
Some malicious tokens have been observed to include malicious javascript in their name attribute, allowing attackers to extract private keys from users who choose to interact with these tokens via vulnerable frontends

## Impact
This may lead to code injection that may attack the protocol and lead to stealing of users funds especially if attacking the the front ends in particular. an example attack is the famous  Etherdelta attack detailed on the link below

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/utils/ChilizWrappedERC20.sol#L25
```solidity 
    function initialize(IERC20 _underlyingToken) external {
        if (msg.sender != factory) revert Forbidden();
        if (_underlyingToken.decimals() >= 18) revert InvalidDecimals();
        if (address(underlyingToken) != address(0)) revert AlreadyExists();

        underlyingToken = _underlyingToken;
        decimalsOffset = 10 ** (18 - _underlyingToken.decimals());
        name = string(abi.encodePacked("Wrapped ", _underlyingToken.name()));
        symbol = string(abi.encodePacked("W", _underlyingToken.symbol()));
    }
```
When initializing an underlying token with wrapping using ChilizWrappedERC20.sol .name() attribute of token is used which may be used as an attack vector 

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate and sanitzie inputs. May be ideal to check the length of the token.name() is within reasonable bounds etc
