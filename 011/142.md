# Anyone can send Funds via skim Function in JaraPair.sol

## Summary
The `skim` function in the `JaraPair.sol` contract allows any user to transfer surplus tokens to any address, presenting a significant security risk where funds can be redirected to an attacker's account without authorization.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `skim` function is intended to adjust the contract's token balances to match the recorded reserves. However, it lacks proper access control, enabling any external caller to execute the function and potentially drain the contract's surplus tokens by specifying an arbitrary destination address.

## Impact
This vulnerability poses a severe risk of unauthorized fund withdrawal, allowing attackers or malicious actors to siphon off surplus tokens stored in the contract. It undermines the security and integrity of the contract, potentially leading to loss of funds and loss of trust in the platform.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaPair.sol#L262-L268
POC:
```solidity
function test_fuzz_SkimFunctionCanBeAbused(address attacker) public {
    // Assuming `attacker` is an arbitrary address and `pairAddress` is the deployed JaraPair contract
    uint256 initialBalanceAttacker = IERC20(token0).balanceOf(attacker);
    // `skim` to attacker's address to simulate the attack
    vm.prank(attacker);
    JaraPair(pairAddress).skim(attacker);

    uint256 postSkimBalanceAttacker = IERC20(token0).balanceOf(attacker);
    // Assert that the attacker's balance has increased, indicating the skim was successful
    assert(postSkimBalanceAttacker > initialBalanceAttacker);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement strict access control checks to ensure that only authorized addresses (e.g., the contract owner or a designated maintainer) can call the skim function. This can be achieved by adding a modifier that checks the caller's address or by utilizing existing access control mechanisms such as OpenZeppelin's Ownable or AccessControl.
