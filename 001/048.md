# Potential Loss of Funds Due to Rounding Errors in withdrawTo Function

## Summary
Loss of funds due to rounding errors in the `withdrawTo `function of the ChilizWrappedERC20 contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdrawTo` function in the ChilizWrappedERC20 contract is responsible for unwrapping wrapped tokens back into the underlying tokens. The function calculates the amount of underlying tokens to unwrap based on a `decimalsOffset`, which accounts for the difference in decimals between the wrapped and underlying tokens.

However, due to integer division, there is a potential for rounding errors that can lead to a loss of funds. This occurs when the amount of wrapped tokens being unwrapped does not evenly divide by the `decimalsOffset`, resulting in a remainder.

### Scenario:
Let's assume `msg.sender` is the `account`
Let's assume `decimalsOffset`: 10^12
User attempts to withdraw: 88 * 10^11 wrapped tokens  // 8.8 *10^12
Calculated `unwrapAmount`: 88 * 10^11 / 10^12 = 8 underlying tokens
`burntAmount`: 8 * 10^12 wrapped tokens
The contract burns 8 * 10^12 wrapped tokens and transfers 8 underlying tokens to the user.
The remaining 800000000000 wrapped tokens (0.8 * 10^12) are not accounted for when `msg.sender` is the same as account.

## Impact
When `msg.sender` is the same as `account`, the remaining wrapped tokens, which should be returned to the user or burned, are neither. This results in a loss of these tokens.

## Code Snippet
[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/utils/ChilizWrappedERC20.sol#L45-#L60)
```javascript
 function withdrawTo(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
        if (address(underlyingToken) == address(0)) revert NotInitialized();
        uint256 unwrapAmount = amount / decimalsOffset;
        if (unwrapAmount == 0) revert CannotWithdraw();
        address msgSender = _msgSender();
        uint256 burntAmount = unwrapAmount * decimalsOffset;
        _burn(msgSender, burntAmount);
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(underlyingToken, account, unwrapAmount);
        if (msgSender != account) {
            _transfer(msgSender, account, amount - burntAmount);
        }

        emit Withdraw(account, amount);

        return true;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a mechanism to handle the remainder after the division, ensuring that all wrapped tokens are either unwrapped or transferred, with no loss due to rounding. This could involve updating the contract logic to track and refund the remainder to the user or to burn the remainder, depending on the intended behavior of the contract.


```diff

function withdrawTo(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
    if (address(underlyingToken) == address(0)) revert NotInitialized();
    uint256 unwrapAmount = amount / decimalsOffset;
    if (unwrapAmount == 0) revert CannotWithdraw();
    address msgSender = _msgSender();
    uint256 burntAmount = unwrapAmount * decimalsOffset;
    uint256 remainder = amount - burntAmount; // Calculate the remainder

    _burn(msgSender, burntAmount);
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(underlyingToken, account, unwrapAmount);

    // Handle the remainder
    if (remainder > 0) {
        if (msgSender != account) {
            // If the sender is not the account, transfer the remainder wrapped tokens to the account
            _transfer(msgSender, account, remainder);
+        } else {
+           // If the sender is the account, burn the remainder wrapped tokens
+            _burn(msgSender, remainder);
        }
    }

    emit Withdraw(account, amount);

    return true;
}
```
