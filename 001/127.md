# The `amountOutMin` values are not being converted to the underlying token decimals in some functions of `JalaMasterRouter`

## Summary
In some of the functions in the `JalaMasterRouter`, the `amountOutMin` values are not being converted to the underlying token decimals, leaving the users of the contract susceptible to sandwich attacks

## Vulnerability Detail
The `removeLiquidityAndUnwrapToken`, `removeLiquidityETHAndUnwrap`, `swapExactTokensForTokens` and `swapExactETHForTokens` functions in the `JalaMasterRouter` contract are used for adding liquidity and performing token swaps, using the `ChilizWrappedERC20` token-counterpart Jala pairs of the tokens that are passed in to them. However, there is a problem with all of those functions. The problem is that the `amountOutMin` values in all of them are not being scaled up in order to match the underlying output token decimals.

Taking `swapExactTokensForTokens` as an example:

```solidity
    function swapExactTokensForTokens(
        address originTokenAddress,
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 amountOutMin,
        address[] calldata path,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external virtual override returns (uint256[] memory amounts, address reminderTokenAddress, uint256 reminder) {
        address wrappedTokenIn = IChilizWrapperFactory(wrapperFactory).wrappedTokenFor(originTokenAddress);

        require(path[0] == wrappedTokenIn, "MS: !path");

        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(originTokenAddress, msg.sender, address(this), amountIn);
        _approveAndWrap(originTokenAddress, amountIn);
        IERC20(wrappedTokenIn).approve(router, IERC20(wrappedTokenIn).balanceOf(address(this)));

        amounts = IJalaRouter02(router).swapExactTokensForTokens(
            IERC20(wrappedTokenIn).balanceOf(address(this)),
            amountOutMin,
            path,
            address(this),
            deadline
        );
        (reminderTokenAddress, reminder) = _unwrapAndTransfer(path[path.length - 1], to);
    }
```

As it can be seen in that function, an amount of the input token, that is equal to the `amountIn` is being wrapped in its respective wrapped token and then the **wrapped token balance** of the `JalaMasterRouter` contract is passed in as the `amountIn` argument of the swap call to the `JalaRouter02` contract. However, unlike the `amountIn`, the `amountOutMin` is not being touched at all and is just passed in as it is. What this effectively means, given the fact that the protocol is going to be working with 0 decimal tokens (such as BAR and PSG), is that there will practically be close to no slippage protection when performing a swap for some of those tokens, given the fact that all wrapped tokens have 18 decimals.

## Impact
Users will practically have no slippage protection in place, leaving them vulnerable to sandwich attacks

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Scale up the `amountOutMin` values using the decimal offset of the respective wrapped tokens
