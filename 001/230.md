# In the `ChilizWrappedERC20::withdrawTo` function, if the transfer fails, it will result in the tokens being incorrectly burnt first.

## Summary:

In the `ChilizWrappedERC20::withdrawTo` function, it is observed that the business logic involves burning tokens first and then transferring them. If the token transfer fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, which will result in the previous tokens being incorrectly burnt.

## Vulnerability Detail
Error scenario:
1. The user wants to call `withdrawTo` to withdraw a certain amount of tokens and transfer them to a specified account.
2. However, it is required to burn a certain amount of tokens first and then transfer a certain amount of tokens to the specified account.
3. At this point, if the token transfer fails and the transaction is rolled back, it will result in the previous tokens being incorrectly burnt.

## Impact

If the token transfer fails, it will indeed result in the previous tokens being incorrectly burnt.

## Code Snippet:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/utils/ChilizWrappedERC20.sol#L45-L55

```js
function withdrawTo(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
    if (address(underlyingToken) == address(0)) revert NotInitialized();
    uint256 unwrapAmount = amount / decimalsOffset;
    if (unwrapAmount == 0) revert CannotWithdraw();
    address msgSender = _msgSender();
    uint256 burntAmount = unwrapAmount * decimalsOffset;
@>    _burn(msgSender, burntAmount);
@>    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(underlyingToken, account, unwrapAmount);
    if (msgSender != account) {
        _transfer(msgSender, account, amount - burntAmount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation:

The correct order should indeed be to transfer the tokens first and then proceed with burning them.

```diff
function withdrawTo(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
    if (address(underlyingToken) == address(0)) revert NotInitialized();
    uint256 unwrapAmount = amount / decimalsOffset;
    if (unwrapAmount == 0) revert CannotWithdraw();
    address msgSender = _msgSender();
    uint256 burntAmount = unwrapAmount * decimalsOffset;
-   _burn(msgSender, burntAmount);
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(underlyingToken, account, unwrapAmount);
+   _burn(msgSender, burntAmount);
    if (msgSender != account) {
        _transfer(msgSender, account, amount - burntAmount);
    }
```
