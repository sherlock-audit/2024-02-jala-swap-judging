# `JalaPair::_update` reverts due to underflow

## Summary

The `JalaPair::_update` function reverts due to the desired overflow inherited from UniswapV2 fork logic.
## Vulnerability Detail

When calculating `timeElapsed`, the following calculation is made: `uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast;`. Where `uint32 blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp % 2 ** 32);` and `blockTimestampLast` is the result of the same calculation but on the previous call to the `_update` function. This underflow situation is really likely to happen, in fact the code has a comment saying that overflow is desired.

Because of this, some transactions will go through and others won't depending on the `block.timestamp` value.
## Impact

The whole functionality of the DEX will be affected and working intermittently. Users will experience funds unavailability.

## Tool used

Manual Review
## Recommendation

To let the calculation overflow or underflow, add the `unchecked` label to the code:

```diff
    // update reserves and, on the first call per block, price accumulators
    function _update(uint256 balance0, uint256 balance1, uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1) private {
        if (balance0 > type(uint112).max || balance1 > type(uint112).max) revert Overflow();
        uint32 blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp % 2 ** 32);
-       uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
+       uint32 timeElapsed;
+       unchecked {
+          timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast;
+       }
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
            // * never overflows, and + overflow is desired
            price0CumulativeLast += uint256(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve1).uqdiv(_reserve0)) * timeElapsed;
            price1CumulativeLast += uint256(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve0).uqdiv(_reserve1)) * timeElapsed;
        }
        reserve0 = uint112(balance0);
        reserve1 = uint112(balance1);
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }
```
