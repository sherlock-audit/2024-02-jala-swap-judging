# ```_update``` function in ```JalaPair.sol``` will revert when ```priceCumulativeLast```overflows

## Summary
```JalaPair.sol``` is forked from UniSwapV2 source code. In the ```_update``` function,  ```timeElapsed```, ```price0CumulativeLast``` and ```price1CumulativeLast``` are meant to overflow and they do overflow. This is its intended behaviour and it works fine if the solidity version is ```<0.8.0```. Since ```JalaPair.sol``` uses ```^0.8.0```, function ```_update``` will revert when any of those variables overflow.

## Vulnerability Detail
```_update``` will revert when ```priceCumulativeLast``` addition overflows.

This issue is similar to this one found on another audit:

## Impact
Function ```_update``` is invoked internally by ```mint()```, ```burn()```, ```swap()``` and ```sync()``` so all these functions will revert when the desired overflow happens making ```JalaPair.sol``` not function as intended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Wrap the operations around ```unchecked {}``` to allow overflow without reverting.
