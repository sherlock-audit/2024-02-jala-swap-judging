# Denial of Service through Balance Manipulation in DeFi Protocol Skim Function

## Summary
The 'skim' function within the DeFi protocol's liquidity pool contract is vulnerable to Denial of Service through Balance Manipulation. An attacker can disrupt the function's operation by sending additional tokens to the contract immediately after the balance check but prior to the completion of the '_safeTransfer' function calls. This discrepancy between the expected and actual balances can result in a transfer failure, potentially leading to locked funds, disrupted operations, and griefing.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability in the code lies in lines 265 and 266. In these lines, the skim function transfers the entire balance of _token0 and _token1 to the to address, except for the reserve amounts reserve0 and reserve1 respectively. This can be exploited by an attacker to drain the contract's balance by repeatedly calling the skim function, causing a denial of service by manipulating the contract's balance.

The root cause of this vulnerability is that the skim function does not have any restrictions or checks in place to prevent multiple calls that could drain the contract's balance. To mitigate this vulnerability, the function should include checks to limit the amount that can be skimmed in a single transaction or impose restrictions on who can call the function. Additionally, it is important to carefully consider the logic of balance manipulation functions in DeFi protocols to prevent such vulnerabilities.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by draining the contract's balance of token0 and token1, causing the contract to fail when attempting to transfer tokens in the skim function. This can result in the contract becoming unusable and locking up the funds.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) :**

1. Deploy a malicious contract that will repeatedly call the skim function of the vulnerable contract.
2. Transfer a large amount of token0 and token1 to the vulnerable contract.
3. The malicious contract will call the skim function multiple times, draining the balance of token0 and token1 from the vulnerable contract.
4. As a result, the vulnerable contract will run out of tokens to transfer, causing it to fail and become unusable.

By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can disrupt the normal operation of the DeFi protocol and potentially cause financial losses to users interacting with the protocol. It is important for developers to always validate the availability of funds before executing token transfers in smart contracts to prevent such vulnerabilities.
## Impact
The vulnerability arises due to a lack of real-time validation of the contract's token balances against the intended transfer amounts, just before executing the transfer.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, you should update the contract's balance after transferring tokens out in the skim function. Here is an example of how you can patch the code:

```solidity
262       function skim(address to) external lock {
263           address _token0 = token0; // gas savings
264           address _token1 = token1; // gas savings
265           uint256 balance0 = IERC20(_token0).balanceOf(address(this)) - reserve0;
266           uint256 balance1 = IERC20(_token1).balanceOf(address(this)) - reserve1;
267           _safeTransfer(_token0, to, balance0);
268           _safeTransfer(_token1, to, balance1);
269           reserve0 = IERC20(_token0).balanceOf(address(this));
270           reserve1 = IERC20(_token1).balanceOf(address(this));
271       }
```
In this patched code, we first calculate the updated balances of token0 and token1 after the transfer. Then, we transfer the tokens to the specified address. Finally, we update the reserve balances of token0 and token1 to reflect the changes made in the skim function. This ensures that the contract's balance is properly updated, preventing the possibility of a denial of service attack through balance manipulation.
