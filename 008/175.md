# Potential manipulation of liquidity pools due to tokens with arbitrary minting capabilities.

## Summary
Potential manipulation of liquidity pools due to tokens with arbitrary minting capabilities.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_addLiquidity `function is designed to add liquidity based on current reserves of the token pair. If a token in the pair can be arbitrarily minted, an attacker could inflate the reserves by depositing a large number of minted tokens just before a legitimate liquidity addition transaction is confirmed, thus affecting the price ratio and the amount of liquidity tokens the user receives.
## Impact
Users may receive fewer liquidity tokens than expected, leading to a loss of funds

## Code Snippet
[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaRouter02.sol#L31-#L58)
```javascript
function _addLiquidity(
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        uint256 amountADesired,
        uint256 amountBDesired,
        uint256 amountAMin,
        uint256 amountBMin
    ) internal virtual returns (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) {
        // create the pair if it doesn't exist yet
        if (IJalaFactory(factory).getPair(tokenA, tokenB) == address(0)) {
            IJalaFactory(factory).createPair(tokenA, tokenB);
        }
        (uint256 reserveA, uint256 reserveB) = JalaLibrary.getReserves(factory, tokenA, tokenB);
        if (reserveA == 0 && reserveB == 0) {
            (amountA, amountB) = (amountADesired, amountBDesired);
        } else {
            uint256 amountBOptimal = JalaLibrary.quote(amountADesired, reserveA, reserveB);
            if (amountBOptimal <= amountBDesired) {
                if (amountBOptimal < amountBMin) revert InsufficientBAmount();
                (amountA, amountB) = (amountADesired, amountBOptimal);
            } else {
                uint256 amountAOptimal = JalaLibrary.quote(amountBDesired, reserveB, reserveA);
                assert(amountAOptimal <= amountADesired);
                if (amountAOptimal < amountAMin) revert InsufficientAAmount();
                (amountA, amountB) = (amountAOptimal, amountBDesired);
            }
        }
    }

```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Tokens with arbitrary minting capabilities should not be allowed in liquidity pools, or their minting function should be restricted to a governance process.
Implement additional validation to detect significant changes in reserves that occur between the initiation and execution of liquidity addition transactions.
