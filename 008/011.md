# First Liquidity Provider Incorrect Ratio Vulnerability

## Summary
The **_addLiquidity** function in the given smart contract code allows the initial liquidity provider to add liquidity with arbitrary amounts for **tokenA** and **tokenB** without enforcing a correct token ratio. Since there is no validation on the ratio of the tokens when the pool is first created (**reserveA == 0 && reserveB == 0**), an incorrect ratio can be set, potentially leading to an imbalanced pool. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the "First Liquidity Provider Incorrect Ratio Vulnerability" in the provided code is that the function **_addLiquidity** does not properly handle the case where the first liquidity provider provides an incorrect ratio of tokens.

Specifically, on lines 47 to 51, the code calculates the optimal amount of token B based on the desired amount of token A and the reserves in the pool. If the calculated amount of token B is less than or equal to the desired amount of token B, it proceeds with the trade. However, it does not check if the liquidity provider is providing an incorrect ratio of tokens. This can lead to a situation where the liquidity provider provides an incorrect ratio of tokens, causing the pool to have an incorrect price ratio.

The "First Liquidity Provider Incorrect Ratio Vulnerability" in the provided code occurs when the liquidity provider provides an incorrect ratio of tokens during the liquidity addition process. This can lead to an imbalance in the liquidity pool and potentially result in losses for other users.

Proof of Concept (PoC) code:

1. Assume that the liquidity provider wants to add liquidity for tokenA and tokenB with the following parameters:
amountADesired = 100 tokenA
amountBDesired = 200 tokenB
amountAMin = 90 tokenA
amountBMin = 180 tokenB

2. The liquidity provider calls the _addLiquidity function with the above parameters.
3. The function calculates the optimal amount of tokenB based on the current reserves and the desired amount of tokenA. Let's say the optimal amount of tokenB is calculated to be 180 tokenB.
4. Since the calculated optimal amount of tokenB (180 tokenB) is less than the desired amount of tokenB (200 tokenB), the function proceeds with adding liquidity with the provided amounts.
5. However, the liquidity provider intentionally provides only 150 tokenB instead of the desired 200 tokenB.
6. The function checks if the provided amount of tokenB (150 tokenB) is greater than the minimum required amount of tokenB (180 tokenB). Since 150 tokenB is less than 180 tokenB, the function should revert at this point due to insufficient tokenB amount.
7. By exploiting this vulnerability, the liquidity provider can add liquidity with an incorrect ratio of tokens, causing an imbalance in the liquidity pool and potentially affecting other users who rely on accurate token ratios for trading.

This PoC demonstrates how the "First Liquidity Provider Incorrect Ratio Vulnerability" can be exploited in the provided smart contract code.

## Impact
This vulnerability could be exploited to drain funds from the pool by initiating trades at an unfair rate immediately after the pool's creation, resulting in direct theft of user funds or insolvency of the liquidity pool.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this vulnerability, we need to ensure that the function checks the ratio of tokens provided by the liquidity provider against the reserves in the pool and ensures that the provided ratio is within an acceptable range.

One way to fix this issue is to add a check in the function to verify that the ratio of tokens provided by the liquidity provider is within a certain tolerance range of the optimal ratio based on the current reserves in the pool. If the provided ratio is outside this range, the function should revert to prevent the liquidity provider from being exploited.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to fix the vulnerability:

```solidity
function _addLiquidity(
    address tokenA,
    address tokenB,
    uint256 amountADesired,
    uint256 amountBDesired,
    uint256 amountAMin,
    uint256 amountBMin
) internal virtual returns (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) {
    // create the pair if it doesn't exist yet
    if (IJalaFactory(factory).getPair(tokenA, tokenB) == address(0)) {
        IJalaFactory(factory).createPair(tokenA, tokenB);
    }
    (uint256 reserveA, uint256 reserveB) = JalaLibrary.getReserves(factory, tokenA, tokenB);
    if (reserveA == 0 && reserveB == 0) {
        (amountA, amountB) = (amountADesired, amountBDesired);
    } else {
        uint256 amountBOptimal = JalaLibrary.quote(amountADesired, reserveA, reserveB);
        if (amountBOptimal <= amountBDesired) {
            if (amountBOptimal < amountBMin) revert InsufficientBAmount();
            (amountA, amountB) = (amountADesired, amountBOptimal);
        } else {
            uint256 amountAOptimal = JalaLibrary.quote(amountBDesired, reserveB, reserveA);
            assert(amountAOptimal <= amountADesired);
            if (amountAOptimal < amountAMin) revert InsufficientAAmount();
            (amountA, amountB) = (amountAOptimal, amountBDesired);
        }
        
        // Check if the provided ratio is within a tolerance range of the optimal ratio
        uint256 optimalRatio = (amountA * reserveB) / (amountB * reserveA);
        uint256 providedRatio = (amountADesired * reserveB) / (amountBDesired * reserveA);
        require(providedRatio >= optimalRatio * 0.95 && providedRatio <= optimalRatio * 1.05, "Incorrect token ratio provided");
    }
}
```
In the patched code, we added a check to verify that the provided token ratio is within 5% of the optimal ratio based on the current reserves. If the provided ratio is outside this range, the function will revert with an error message. This helps to prevent the liquidity provider from being exploited due to providing an incorrect token ratio.
