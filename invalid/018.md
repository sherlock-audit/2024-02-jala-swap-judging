# Potential Loss of ETH due to Contract's Inability to Receive Funds in swapExactTokensForETH Function

## Summary
The **swapExactTokensForETH** function in the provided Solidity code contains a vulnerability that could result in the permanent loss of Ether (ETH) when the recipient address (to) is a contract that lacks a payable fallback or receive function. This function conducts a token-to-ETH swap and attempts to transfer the resulting ETH to the to address. However, if the to address is a contract that is not designed to receive ETH (i.e., no payable fallback or receive function), the **safeTransferETH** call will revert and the transaction will fail. Since the ETH has already been withdrawn from the WETH contract and is held by the contract that executed **swapExactTokensForETH**, the reverted transaction could leave the ETH inaccessible within this contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Potential Loss of ETH due to Contract's Inability to Receive Funds in **swapExactTokensForETH** Function" in the provided code is that the contract does not have a fallback function to receive Ether.

In line 330, the contract calls **IWETH(WETH).withdraw(amounts[amounts.length - 1]);** to withdraw the ETH from the contract. However, if the contract receives ETH directly (e.g., through a self-destruct call or a transfer from another contract), it will not be able to receive and hold the ETH because there is no fallback function defined to handle incoming Ether.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can perform the following steps:

1. The attacker can create a malicious token contract that triggers the swapExactTokensForETH function of the vulnerable contract.
2. The attacker can then call the swapExactTokensForETH function with a large amountIn value and specify their own address as the to parameter.
3. Since the vulnerable contract is unable to receive ETH directly in this function, the ETH obtained from the swap will be stuck in the contract.
4. The attacker can then repeat this process multiple times, causing a significant loss of ETH in the vulnerable contract.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

```solidity
// Vulnerable contract
contract VulnerableContract {
    function swapExactTokensForETH(
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 amountOutMin,
        address[] calldata path,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external virtual ensure(deadline) returns (uint256[] memory amounts) {
        // Function logic
    }
    
    // Fallback function to receive ETH
    receive() external payable {}
}

// Malicious token contract
contract MaliciousToken {
    VulnerableContract vulnerableContract = VulnerableContract(address_of_vulnerable_contract);
    
    function exploit() external {
        // Call the vulnerable function with a large amountIn value
        vulnerableContract.swapExactTokensForETH(
            1000 ether, // Large amountIn value
            0,
            [address(token), address(vulnerableContract.WETH)],
            msg.sender, // Attacker's address
            block.timestamp + 1000
        );
        
        // Repeat the exploit to cause a loss of ETH in the vulnerable contract
    }
}
```


## Impact
 This vulnerability directly leads to a financial loss for the user who expected to receive ETH at their provided **to** address, and could also disrupt the operations of a smart contract dependent on the reception of these funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, you can implement a receive function in the contract that allows it to receive ETH. Here is an example of how you can patch the code:

```solidity
// Add a receive function to the contract
receive() external payable {}

function swapExactTokensForETH(
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 amountOutMin,
    address[] calldata path,
    address to,
    uint256 deadline
) external virtual override ensure(deadline) returns (uint256[] memory amounts) {
    if (path[path.length - 1] != WETH) revert JalaLibrary.InvalidPath();
    amounts = JalaLibrary.getAmountsOut(factory, amountIn, path);
    if (amounts[amounts.length - 1] < amountOutMin) revert JalaLibrary.InsufficientOutputAmount();
    TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
        path[0],
        msg.sender,
        JalaLibrary.pairFor(factory, path[0], path[1]),
        amounts[0]
    );
    _swap(amounts, path, address(this));
    IWETH(WETH).withdraw(amounts[amounts.length - 1]);
    TransferHelper.safeTransferETH(to, amounts[amounts.length - 1]);
}
```
By adding the receive function to the contract, it will be able to receive ETH directly. This will prevent any potential loss of ETH due to the contract's inability to receive funds in the **swapExactTokensForETH** function.
