# Unimplemented ERC-20 transferFrom Function Leads to Wrapped Token Transfer Failure

## Summary
The smart contract function '**createWrappedToken**' is vulnerable due to the reliance on an unimplemented '**transferFrom**' function as part of its intended ERC-20 token wrapping mechanism. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Unimplemented ERC-20 transferFrom Function Leads to Wrapped Token Transfer Failure" in the provided code is that the function **createWrappedToken** does not implement the **transferFrom** function of the ERC-20 standard.

The **transferFrom** function is a crucial part of the ERC-20 standard that allows tokens to be transferred on behalf of another address. Without implementing this function, the wrapped token created by the **createWrappedToken** function will not be able to transfer tokens on behalf of the user, leading to potential transfer failures and issues with the functionality of the wrapped token.
## Impact
This unimplemented function causes the contract to revert transactions, potentially leading to the freezing of funds and protocol insolvency, as users are unable to transfer the wrapped tokens created by this function. The vulnerability constitutes a significant risk to the protocol's operation and token liquidity.

The vulnerability in the code is that the **createWrappedToken** function does not implement the ERC-20 **transferFrom** function, which could lead to wrapped token transfer failure.

Proof of Concept (PoC) code:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ERC20 {
    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract MaliciousContract {
    address public vulnerableContract;
    address public underlyingToken;
    
    constructor(address _vulnerableContract, address _underlyingToken) {
        vulnerableContract = _vulnerableContract;
        underlyingToken = _underlyingToken;
    }
    
    function exploit() public {
        ERC20 token = ERC20(underlyingToken);
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, vulnerableContract, 100); // Call to unimplemented transferFrom function
    }
}
```
In this PoC code, a malicious contract is created with the ability to call the **transferFrom** function on the underlying token without the function being implemented in the vulnerable contract. This could lead to wrapped token transfer failure as the **transferFrom** function is not properly handled in the vulnerable contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, the **createWrappedToken** function should implement the **transferFrom** function from the ERC-20 standard. This function allows approved addresses to transfer tokens on behalf of the token owner.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to include the **transferFrom** function:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyToken {
    mapping(address => uint256) balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) allowed;

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
        require(allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value, "Allowance not enough");
        require(balances[_from] >= _value, "Balance not enough");

        balances[_from] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        allowed[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;

        return true;
    }

    function createWrappedToken(address underlyingToken) public returns (address) {
        if (underlyingToWrapped[underlyingToken] != address(0)) revert AlreadyExists();
        return _createWrappedToken(underlyingToken);
    }

    function _createWrappedToken(address underlyingToken) private returns (address) {
        // Implementation of creating wrapped token
    }
}
```
By adding the **transferFrom** function to the smart contract, the vulnerability of unimplemented ERC-20 **transferFrom** function leading to wrapped token transfer failure is addressed.
