# Manipulation of  `setFlashFee` in  `JalaFactory.sol` 

## Summary
Admin can `setFlashFee` up to 100%. This is bad for users, fees should have a reasonable upper limit, e.g. 30% to prevent potential griefing.

## Vulnerability Detail

I think this is bad for users, as you need extra trust on an admin to not exploit this, and smart contracts should aim for as little external trust as possible.

## Impact
- User Risk: Users are exposed to the risk of high fees, which may not be reasonable or fair.
- Trust Dependency: The smart contract relies on trusting the admin not to exploit the ability to set fees to extreme values.
- Decreased Participation due to fear unpredictable and potentially unfair fee structures.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a reasonable upper limit, e.g. 30%.
Consider using a timelock, so that users have time to react and adjust. In that way, users would know the fees they are agreeing with.
