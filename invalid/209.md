# Unnecessary call to `_transfer` function inside `ChilizWrappedERC20:withdrawTo` will leads to gas Griefing

## Summary
The `withdrawTo` function checks if msg.sender != account, then it will transfer wrapped tokens to the `account`. However, it does not check if `amount - burntAmount` is greater than zero. In this case, all calls to `_transfer` are a waste of gas.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol facilitates the conversion of wrapped tokens back to underlying tokens via the `ChilizWrappedERC20:withdrawTo` function. This function can be called by `ChilizWrapperFactory:unwrap` or directly by the owner of the wrapped token.

The `withdrawTo` function converts the specified amount to underlying tokens and transfers them to the `account` address. It also checks if the `msg.sender` is not the owner account, in this case it sends the wrapped tokens to the `account` address. However, it also calls the `_transfer` function in the case where `amount - burnAmount == 0`, which does not change any balance but consumes additional gas. This leads to Griefing attack or wastes gas for end users.

## Impact
Users will be paying extra gas due to missing checks.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
 function withdrawTo(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) { // 11
        if (address(underlyingToken) == address(0)) revert NotInitialized();
        uint256 unwrapAmount = amount / decimalsOffset;
        if (unwrapAmount == 0) revert CannotWithdraw();
        address msgSender = _msgSender(); // msg.sender
        uint256 burntAmount = unwrapAmount * decimalsOffset; 
        _burn(msgSender, burntAmount); // wraped burn 
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(underlyingToken, account, unwrapAmount); 
        if (msgSender != account)  { // @audit-issue : check amount to transfer && amount-burntAmount > 0)
            _transfer(msgSender, account, amount - burntAmount); // 1
        }

        emit Withdraw(account, amount);

        return true;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify if statement to also check for `amount-burnAmount > 0` as follows :
