# Possible Precision Loss in `withdrawTo` function Due to Improper Arithmetic Order

## Summary
The `withdrawTo` function in the provided Solidity contract performs division before multiplication, potentially leading to precision loss. This can occur due to integer division truncation, resulting in inaccurate calculations when converting wrapped tokens back to the underlying ERC20 tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `withdrawTo` function, the following code snippet is responsible for calculating the amount of underlying tokens to be withdrawn and the corresponding burnt amount of wrapped tokens:
```solidity
uint256 unwrapAmount = amount / decimalsOffset;
uint256 burntAmount = unwrapAmount * decimalsOffset;
```
The purpose of this code is to determine the equivalent amount of underlying tokens (`unwrapAmount`) by dividing the amount of wrapped tokens by the scaling factor `decimalsOffset`. However, due to the order of operations, precision loss may occur. Integer division truncates any remainder, potentially leading to inaccuracies when converting back and forth between wrapped and underlying tokens.
## Impact
The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential loss of precision in token conversions. Inaccurate calculations may result in users receiving slightly fewer or more underlying tokens than expected when withdrawing wrapped tokens, affecting the integrity and fairness of token exchanges.

## Recommendation
 it's crucial to reorder the arithmetic operations to perform multiplication before division.
