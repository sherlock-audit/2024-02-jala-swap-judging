# Centralization Risk in JalaPair.sol Due to Multiple initialize Function Calls

## Summary
A centralization vulnerability exists in the `JalaPair.sol` smart contract due to the `initialize` function being callable multiple times without restrictions. This can lead to centralization risks, undermining the decentralization principle of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `initialize` function in `JalaPair.sol` is designed to be called by the factory contract to set the token pairs for a swap operation. However, the lack of a mechanism to prevent multiple invocations of this function by the factory contract creates a centralization risk, as the factory contract can arbitrarily change the token pairs by calling `initialize` multiple times.

## Impact
This vulnerability poses a significant risk of centralization, allowing the factory contract owner to manipulate the token pairs, potentially disrupting the proper functioning of the decentralized exchange and affecting user transactions.

## Code Snippet


POC Paste the above code in JalaPair.t.sol to test the vulnerability using Foundry.:
```solidity
function textCallInitializeManyTimes(address pairAddress_) public {
    vm.startPrank(factory);
    JalaPair(pairAddress_).initialize(address(0), address(0));
    JalaPair(pairAddress_).initialize(address(1), address(1));
    vm.stopPrank(factory);
}

```

## Tool used
Manual Review, Foundry


## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a mechanism that ensures the initialize function can only be called once. This could involve setting a state variable upon the first call to initialize and checking this variable to prevent future invocations.
