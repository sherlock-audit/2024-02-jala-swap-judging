# Each JalaPair instance locks two unwrapped tokens from pair permanently

## Summary

The purpose of JalaSwap is to enable swapping sport-related tokens available on Chiliz Chain by means of wrapped tokens. The sport-related tokens have decimal points set to 0, thus there is a need to wrap them into ERC20 tokens with e.g. 18 decimal places to support swaps of fractional values. To successfully unwrap token the full amount of 10 ** 18 of wrapped token must be provided. JalaSwap is a fork of UniSwap v2 with extensions. During the first liquidity deposit `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` amount  (equal to 10 ** 3) of liquidity tokens is sacrificed to prevent inflation attack on the first deposit. However, the drawback of this security control is that from each tokens in pair single unwrapped coin is permanently locked by the swap solution.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `JalaMasterRouter` accepts unwrapped tokens as an input, then it wraps them by means of `ChilizWrapperFactory` before sending wrapped tokens into `JalaFactory` to process them for liquidity or swapping. The `ChilizWrapperFactory` wraps tokens by means of `ChilizWrappedERC20`. This contract defines `decimalsOffset` parameter used for further wrapping and unwrapping processing of tokens. As sport-related tokens have decimal points set to 0, so this parameter will be always 18 for wrapped versions.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/utils/ChilizWrappedERC20.sol#L18

```solidity
function initialize(IERC20 _underlyingToken) external {
        if (msg.sender != factory) revert Forbidden();
        if (_underlyingToken.decimals() >= 18) revert InvalidDecimals();
        if (address(underlyingToken) != address(0)) revert AlreadyExists();

        underlyingToken = _underlyingToken;
        decimalsOffset = 10 ** (18 - _underlyingToken.decimals());
        name = string(abi.encodePacked("Wrapped ", _underlyingToken.name()));
        symbol = string(abi.encodePacked("W", _underlyingToken.symbol()));
    }
```
Then, to unwrap tokens the `withdrawTo` function must be called which accepts wrapped tokens as input. To unwrap token, the full amount of 10 ** 18 wrapped tokens must be provided. The function attempts to calculate how many unwrapped tokens it can withdraw, and afterwards it refunds residual wrapped tokens that cannot be unwrapped at this time.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/utils/ChilizWrappedERC20.sol#L45

```solidity
    function withdrawTo(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
        if (address(underlyingToken) == address(0)) revert NotInitialized();
        uint256 unwrapAmount = amount / decimalsOffset;
        if (unwrapAmount == 0) revert CannotWithdraw();
        address msgSender = _msgSender();
        uint256 burntAmount = unwrapAmount * decimalsOffset;
        _burn(msgSender, burntAmount);
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(underlyingToken, account, unwrapAmount);
        if (msgSender != account) {
            _transfer(msgSender, account, amount - burntAmount);
        }

        emit Withdraw(account, amount);

        return true;
    }
```

The `mint` function within `JalaPair` sacrifices the `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` of liquidity tokens within the first deposit. At this point of the processing this function operates on the wrapped tokens. In practice this means that a single coin from each token in pair is permanently locked by this mechanism, as it will be not possible to fully remove liquidity from the pair and obtain full, wrapped token.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaPair.sol#L132

```solidity
 function mint(address to) external lock returns (uint256 liquidity) {
...
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            if (IJalaFactory(factory).migrators(msg.sender)) {
                liquidity = IMigrator(msg.sender).desiredLiquidity();
                if (liquidity == 0 || liquidity == type(uint).max) revert BadDesiredLiquidity();
            } else {
                liquidity = Math.sqrt(amount0 * amount1) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
                _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); // permanently lock the first MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY tokens
            }
        } else {
            liquidity = Math.min((amount0 * _totalSupply) / _reserve0, (amount1 * _totalSupply) / _reserve1);
        }
...
    }
```

Within the [UniSwap documentation](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf) it is written:

> Uniswap v2 initially mints shares equal to the geometric mean of the amounts deposited [..] it is possible for the value of a liquidity pool share to grow over time, either by accumulating trading fees or through “donations” to the liquidity pool. In theory, this could result in a situation where the value of the minimum quantity of liquidity pool shares (1e-18 pool shares) is worth so much that it becomes infeasible for small liquidity providers to provide any liquidity. To mitigate this, Uniswap v2 burns the first 1e-15 (0.000000000000001) pool shares that are minted (1000 times the minimum quantity of pool shares), sending them to the zero address instead of to the minter. **This should be a negligible cost for almost any token pair**.11 But it dramatically increases the cost of the above attack. In order to raise the value of a liquidity pool share to $100, the attacker would need to donate $100,000 to the pool, which would be permanently locked up as liquidity.

However, in case of sport-related tokens, the cost is not negligible. E.g. creating  a pair of `OG Fan Token OG` and `Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token PSG` tokens will lock an amount of around $10 at the time of vulnerability reporting.

Having in mind that top 33 Chiliz Tokens are evaluated between and $0.252 and $5.550 (based on the: [Chiliz Tokens
](https://cryptorank.io/blockchains/chiliz?sort=price&direction=desc) ) the total value of locked coins within Jala's pairs is accumulating drastically with each pair created.

## Impact

The overall cost related to creating swap pair and adding first liquidity is not negligible and it is accumulating with each pair created.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to review the design of solution and reconsider the implementation of applied, aforementioned security control and use alternative measures to prevent first deposit inflation attack. An alternative working solution might be a requirement to perform first deposit along with pair creation. Then, the `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` could be minted to the trusted address.
