# Lack of access control in `JalaRouter02: addliquidity` function

## Summary
The Jalaswap protocol has a core functionality of wrapping tokens to 18 decimal in wrapperERC20 token due to varying decimals of different ERC20's and to avert price inaccuracies in pools
## Vulnerability Detail
 The implementation of the core functionality is bypassed with the  `JalaRouter02: addliquidity` and  `JalaRouter02: remove`  liquidity function which are public with no access control
## Impact
Potentials to create a grossly inefficient pool by users of protocol
