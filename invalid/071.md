# M-2 : Accidently sent Funds & Tokens to JalaSwap factory can get stuck causing loss of funds to users

## Summary
The Jalaswap factory does not have an implementation to withdraw struck tokens and eth that will ultimately cause funds to get stuck forever because it is not even upgradable through which we could send the funds back to users.

See the importance of the vulnerabilty as even Openzeppelin has reported it here :

## Vulnerability Detail
The factory contract lacks `withdraw` functions of eth and several tokens due to which funds can get stuck.
## Impact
Loss of funds to users

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a receive function at least for sending back eth so that when the receive function is called , the contract sends back the msg.value to the sender
