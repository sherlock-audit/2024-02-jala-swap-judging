# Potential Fund Freezing in wrapTokenAndaddLiquidityETH Due to External Contract Dependencies

## Summary
 The **wrapTokenAndaddLiquidityETH** function presents a potential vulnerability where users' funds could be permanently or temporarily frozen if the underlying wrapped token contract or the router has a critical issue such as a bug or a pause in functionality. During the execution of **addLiquidityETH**, which is called on the router, any malfunction or halting of these external contracts could lock the funds provided for liquidity.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the "Potential Fund Freezing in wrapTokenAndaddLiquidityETH Due to External Contract Dependencies" vulnerability in the provided code is that the function **wrapTokenAndaddLiquidityETH** is transferring tokens to an external contract (router) and relying on the external contract to handle the transfer of tokens back to the original contract. This creates a potential risk of fund freezing if the external contract does not behave as expected or if there are issues with the token transfer mechanism.

Specifically, in line 85, the code approves the router contract to spend the balance of the wrapped token held by the contract. Then, in lines 87-94, the code calls the **addLiquidityETH** function of the router contract, transferring tokens and ETH to the router contract for liquidity provision. If there are any issues with the router contract or if the **addLiquidityETH** function fails to transfer tokens back to the original contract, funds could be frozen in the router contract.

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in the function **wrapTokenAndaddLiquidityETH** where the contract is dependent on external contracts for token wrapping and liquidity addition. This dependency can potentially lead to fund freezing if the external contracts behave maliciously.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code to exploit the vulnerability:**

1. Deploy a malicious external contract that behaves as follows:

```solidity
contract MaliciousContract {
    function getDecimalsOffset() external pure returns (uint256) {
        // Return a large value to cause an overflow
        return uint256(-1);
    }
}
```
2. Call the **wrapTokenAndaddLiquidityETH** function with the address of the deployed **MaliciousContract** as the **wrappedToken** parameter.

```solidity
// Call the vulnerable function with the address of the malicious contract
wrapTokenAndaddLiquidityETH(
    address(maliciousContract),
    amountTokenDesired,
    amountTokenMin,
    amountETHMin,
    to,
    deadline
);
```
3. The **getDecimalsOffset** function of the **MaliciousContract** will return a large value causing an overflow when multiplied with **amountTokenDesired**. This overflow can lead to unexpected behavior and potential fund freezing in the contract.

By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially freeze funds in the contract by manipulating the external contract dependencies to cause unexpected behavior.

## Impact
This risk is significant due to the reliance on external contracts' continuous and error-free operation for the completion of the liquidity addition process, and it directly impacts the availability and accessibility of users' assets.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One way to fix this issue is to implement a check to ensure that the **addLiquidityETH** function call is successful before proceeding with the rest of the function. This can be achieved by using a try-catch mechanism to handle any potential errors thrown by the external contract.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to address the vulnerability:
```solidity
71       function wrapTokenAndaddLiquidityETH(
72           // only use wrapTokenAndaddLiquidityETH to create pool.
73           address token,
74           uint256 amountTokenDesired,
75           uint256 amountTokenMin,
76           uint256 amountETHMin,
77           address to,
78           uint256 deadline
79       ) external payable virtual override returns (uint256 amountToken, uint256 amountETH, uint256 liquidity) {
80           TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amountTokenDesired);
81           address wrappedToken = _approveAndWrap(token, amountTokenDesired);
82   
83           uint256 tokenOffset = IChilizWrappedERC20(wrappedToken).getDecimalsOffset();
84   
85           IERC20(wrappedToken).approve(router, IERC20(wrappedToken).balanceOf(address(this))); // no need for check return value, bc addliquidity will revert if approve was declined.
86   
87           try IJalaRouter02(router).addLiquidityETH{value: msg.value}(
88               wrappedToken,
89               amountTokenDesired * tokenOffset,
90               amountTokenMin * tokenOffset,
91               amountETHMin,
92               to,
93               deadline
94           ) returns (uint256 _amountToken, uint256 _amountETH, uint256 _liquidity) {
95               amountToken = _amountToken;
96               amountETH = _amountETH;
97               liquidity = _liquidity;
98           } catch {
99               revert("Error adding liquidity");
100          }
101  
102          // refund dust eth, if any
103          if (msg.value > amountETH) TransferHelper.safeTransferETH(msg.sender, msg.value - amountETH);
104          _unwrapAndTransfer(wrappedToken, to);
105      }
```
In the patched code, a try-catch block is added around the **addLiquidityETH** function call to handle any errors that may occur. If an error is caught, the function reverts with an error message. This ensures that the funds are not frozen in the contract due to unexpected behavior from the external contract.
