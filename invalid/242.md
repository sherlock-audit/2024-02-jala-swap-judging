# Precision Loss Due to Division Before Multiplication

## Summary
The `JalaMasterRouter` contract demonstrates a precision loss vulnerability due to the order of arithmetic operations in several functions. The contract's logic involves dividing a token's balance by its decimal offset and subsequently multiplying by the same offset. This can lead to truncation of any fractional remainder during the division, potentially resulting in users receiving less than the expected amount of unwrapped tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
**Affected Functions**

- `removeLiquidityAndUnwrapToken`
  - Calculation of `tokenAReturnAmount` and `tokenBReturnAmount`.
- `removeLiquidityETHAndUnwrap`
  - Calculation of `tokenReturnAmount`.
- `_unwrapAndTransfer` (private function)
  - Calculation of `tokenOutReturnAmount`.

Please note that line numbers 129, 130, 175, and 312 all perform division before multiplication, which can lead to precision loss due to integer division truncation.

```solidity
129:        uint256 tokenAReturnAmount = (amountA / tokenAOffset) * tokenAOffset;
130:        uint256 tokenBReturnAmount = (amountB / tokenBOffset) * tokenBOffset;
.
.
175:        uint256 tokenReturnAmount = (amountToken / tokenOffset) * tokenOffset;
.
.
312:        uint256 tokenOutReturnAmount = (balanceOut / tokenOutOffset) * tokenOutOffset;
```

## Impact
Users may not receive the full amount of tokens they are entitled to when unwrapping, leading to a loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Refactor the affected calculations to perform multiplication before division. This change will preserve the full precision of token amounts during unwrapping operations.
