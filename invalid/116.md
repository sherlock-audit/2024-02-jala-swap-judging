# H-1 : Malicious set of Block proposers can cause liquidity to be stuck causing loss of funds for users

## Summary
Add and Remove liquidity operations depend on ensuring the deadline is `deadline<block.timestamp`
A malicious set of Block proposers can front-run liquidity transactions and DoS the users to either delay their transaction or completely revert just to DoS them. If not allowed to remove liquidity, users may incur a loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
The deadline Liquidity functions have this modifier

```solidity
    modifier ensure(uint256 deadline) {
        if (deadline < block.timestamp) revert Expired();
        _;
    }
```
if this modifier fails, the transaction will revert.
Malicious proposers can revert these transactions for the following benefits:

- Just to DoS the users to damage the protocol reputation
- DoS specific users to not allow removing their liquidity, causing their funds to be stuck in the contract

## Impact
Loss of User funds and loss of protocol functioning

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    modifier ensure(uint256 deadline) {
        if (deadline < block.timestamp) revert Expired();
        _;
    }
```
