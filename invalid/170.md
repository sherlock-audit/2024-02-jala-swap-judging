# Rounding error causing user to loose funds

## Summary
`JalaLibrary::getAmountOut` function has a rounding error, which leads to users loosing funds when swapping pairs.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a rounding error in the `JalaLibrary::getAmountOut` function, causing the `AmountOut` variable to be smaller than 99.7% as desired by the fee (`997`). The smaller the pool, the bigger the rounding error.

## Impact
Users can potentially loose funds when swapping pairs of tokens.

## Recommendation
Remove the `+ amountInWithFee` from the denominator (`denominator`).
