# Users are Unduly Penalized with High Gas Costs for Transactions that Fail due to variable conditions

## Summary
Users are Unduly Penalized with High Gas Costs for Transactions that Fail due to variable conditions.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_addLiquidity` function, `assert` is used to ensure that the optimal amount of `tokenA` to be added to the liquidity pool `amountAOptimal` does not exceed the desired amount `amountADesired` specified by the user.

This condition relies on external inputs `amountADesired`, `amountBDesired`, and the current state of the reserves and the result of a calculation `JalaLibrary.quote`. Because these factors can vary widely and are not invariant, using `assert` here can be inappropriate.

## Impact
If the `assert` condition fails, it will consume all remaining gas, which can be particularly punitive for users, especially in high-gas-price environments.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaRouter02.sol#L53

```solidity
assert(amountAOptimal <= amountADesired);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace `assert` with `require` to improve user experience and enure users are not penalized with high gas costs for transactions that fail

```solidity
require(amountAOptimal <= amountADesired, "Insufficient amountA desired");
```
