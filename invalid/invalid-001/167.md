# Token Transfers from non-existent contracts will always be overlooked due to lack of contract existence checks

## Impact
User gets no token out of a swap but loses the token sent to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Due to the absence of contract existence checks, the pool will always assume that transactions to destructed tokens are successful. Per the solidity docs which state that:

_" The low-level call, delegatecall, and callcode will return success if the calling account is non-existent, as part of the design of EVM. Existence must be checked prior to calling if desired."_

The above condition causes the low level _transfer_ calls the contract makes to a destructed token address always be regarded as successful even though no tokens are actually transferred in actuality.

## Code Snippet
       ```
        // bytes4(keccak256(bytes('approve(address,uint256)')));
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(0x095ea7b3, to, value));
        if (!success || (data.length != 0 && !abi.decode(data, (bool)))) revert ApproveFailed();
      ```
The low level call in the above line of code will always return true for destructed tokens with an active pair, therefore the checks will always pass.

## Recommendation
Although the above situation has a low likelyhood, it is advisable to add a check for existing contract by checking id the token's **extcodesize** is greater than 0 specifying that it is a contract that contains code i.e non-destructed
