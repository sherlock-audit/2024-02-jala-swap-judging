# The protocol is constrained in its ability to interact with a significant number of tokens.

## Summary
In the protocol documentation It was stated that **"JalaSwap anticipates engaging with Chiliz Chain's native token, CHZ, alongside other Fan Tokens within the same ecosystem, including FC Barcelona Fan Token (BAR) and Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token (PSG)."** but this wont be possible as CHZ token, PSG token and most fan tokens within the same ecosystem has 18 decimals and Jalaswap impalements logic that impedes interaction with token with 18 decimals. links to see decimal places of CHZ token: https://etherscan.io/token/0x3506424f91fd33084466f402d5d97f05f8e3b4af#readContract

## Vulnerability Detail
In the Jalaswap Protocol, when a token is deposited, it undergoes a conversion into its wrapped form within the `ChilizWrapperFactory` contract. During the creation and initialization of the wrapped token in the `ChilizWrappedERC20:initialize` function, various checks are performed. Notably, one of the checks is the condition `if (_underlyingToken.decimals() >= 18) revert InvalidDecimals();` This condition implies that Jalaswap is restricted to interacting only with contracts having decimals in the range of 0 to 17. Consequently, this limitation excludes certain tokens such as CHZ token, PSG token, and many fan tokens, despite the protocol's expressed intention to interact with them.
## Impact
The protocol is significantly hampered by limitations that profoundly affect its operational capabilities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- `if (_underlyingToken.decimals() >= 18) revert InvalidDecimals();`
+ `if (_underlyingToken.decimals() > 18) revert InvalidDecimals();`


This will allow for tokens with 18 decimals
