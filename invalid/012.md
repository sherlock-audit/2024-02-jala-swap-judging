# Inadequate Slippage Control in removeLiquidityETH Function Leading to Potential MEV Exploitation

## Summary
The **removeLiquidityETH** function in the smart contract exhibits a Slippage Control Mechanism Deficiency, which potentially allows for the extraction of miner-extractable value (MEV). The function is designed to remove liquidity from a pool and return a minimum expected amount of an ERC20 token and ETH to the user. However, the lack of implementation detail for the internal **removeLiquidity** function raises concerns that it may not enforce the minimum amount checks (**amountTokenMin** and **amountETHMin**). If these checks are not properly implemented, it could result in transactions not being reverted under unfavorable slippage conditions. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability in the removeLiquidityETH function is the lack of adequate slippage control when removing liquidity. This can potentially lead to Miner Extractable Value (MEV) exploitation.

In lines 128 to 147 of the code, the function removes liquidity from a pool by swapping the provided liquidity for tokens and ETH. However, the function does not include any mechanism to account for slippage, which is the difference between the expected price of an asset and the actual price at the time of the trade. This lack of slippage control can allow malicious actors to front-run transactions and manipulate the price of assets, resulting in potential losses for liquidity providers.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can front-run the removeLiquidityETH function call with a higher gas price and manipulate the price slippage to their advantage. By doing so, the attacker can potentially extract additional value from the transaction by executing it at a more favorable exchange rate.

**Here is a Proof of Concept (PoC) to demonstrate how the vulnerability could be exploited:**

1. Attacker monitors pending transactions in the mempool and identifies a removeLiquidityETH transaction with a significant amount of liquidity to be removed.
2. Attacker submits a new transaction with a higher gas price to front-run the original transaction.
3. In the front-run transaction, the attacker manipulates the exchange rate by adjusting the amount of liquidity to be removed and the minimum amount of tokens and ETH to receive.
4. The front-run transaction is included in the block before the original transaction, allowing the attacker to extract additional value from the trade.

By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can potentially profit from the difference in exchange rates between the front-run transaction and the original transaction, leading to MEV exploitation.
## Impact
This vulnerability could be exploited by MEV bots through sandwich attacks, leading to users receiving less than the specified minimums for the ERC20 token and ETH, thus compromising the integrity of the slippage control mechanism and causing financial losses to users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, we can implement slippage control by using a Uniswap-like approach where we calculate the expected amount of tokens and ETH to be received after removing liquidity and compare it with the minimum amounts specified by the user. If the actual amounts received are less than the minimum amounts specified, the transaction should revert.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to include slippage control:

```solidity
128       function removeLiquidityETH(
129           address token,
130           uint256 liquidity,
131           uint256 amountTokenMin,
132           uint256 amountETHMin,
133           address to,
134           uint256 deadline
135       ) public virtual override ensure(deadline) returns (uint256 amountToken, uint256 amountETH) {
136           (uint256 amountTokenExpected, uint256 amountETHExpected) = removeLiquidity(
137               token,
138               WETH,
139               liquidity,
140               0, // Set slippage control to 0
141               0, // Set slippage control to 0
142               address(this),
143               deadline
144           );
145           
146           require(amountTokenExpected >= amountTokenMin, "Slippage control: Insufficient amount of token received");
147           require(amountETHExpected >= amountETHMin, "Slippage control: Insufficient amount of ETH received");
148           
149           TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, to, amountTokenExpected);
150           IWETH(WETH).withdraw(amountETHExpected);
151           TransferHelper.safeTransferETH(to, amountETHExpected);
152       }
```
