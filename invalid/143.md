# Lack of Deadline Check in Swap Function

## Summary
The `swap` function in the provided contract lacks a deadline check, which could expose users to potential front-running attacks and unfair trading practices. A deadline check is essential to ensure that trades are executed within a specified timeframe, protecting users from manipulation.
## Vulnerability Detail
The swap function in the contract allows users to swap tokens without imposing any deadline constraint. Below is the code snippet of the swap function:
```solidity
function swap(uint256 amount0Out, uint256 amount1Out, address to, bytes calldata data) external lock {
    // Omitted for brevity
    // No deadline check implemented here
    // Omitted for brevity
}
```
The absence of a deadline check leaves the swap function vulnerable to front-running attacks, where malicious actors exploit the delay between the transaction submission and its execution on the blockchain. Without a deadline, attackers could monitor pending transactions and manipulate the market by inserting their own transactions with more favorable terms before legitimate trades are executed.
## Impact
The lack of a deadline check in the swap function could result in users being exposed to front-running attacks, leading to unfair trading practices, price manipulation, and potential financial losses.
