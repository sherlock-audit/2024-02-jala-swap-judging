## Summary
High-level access functions in , especially those with administrative privileges, can lead to points of failure due to their potential for misuse and unauthorized access. These functions, if compromised, can allow attackers to escalate privileges, leading to unauthorized control or access to sensitive data and functionalities. Insecure direct object references, where user inputs aren't properly validated, can exacerbate this risk, allowing attackers to manipulate the system. Ensuring robust access control and validation mechanisms is crucial to mitigate these vulnerabilities
