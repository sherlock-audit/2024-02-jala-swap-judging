# Excessive Fee Minting in JalaPair Contract

## Summary
Excessive Fee Minting in JalaPair Contract as reserve value is used to mint fee depending on the number of times mint(...) function is called.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function mint(address to) external lock returns (uint256 liquidity) {
        (uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1, ) = getReserves(); // gas savings
        uint256 balance0 = IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 balance1 = IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 amount0 = balance0 - _reserve0;
        uint256 amount1 = balance1 - _reserve1;

 >>>       bool feeOn = _mintFee(_reserve0, _reserve1);
...
```
As noted from the mint function provided above from the JalaPair.sol contract, _mintFee(...) is called using the value reserves, The problem is there is no limitation to the number of times this mint can be called repeatedly and the value used to mint fee is the reserve not the new incoming amount, this can be used to drain the contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Protocol should only mint fee based on new incoming amount or limit the rate at which fee can be minted with reserve value
