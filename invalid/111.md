# Unexpected behaviour of `JalaMasterRouter`

## Summary
When a user swaps tokens or adds liquidity `JalaMasterRouter` behaves not like `JalaRouter02`

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaRouter02.sol#L31)

```solidity
    contract JalaRouter02 is IJalaRouter02 {
     ...
    function addLiquidity(
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        uint256 amountADesired,
        uint256 amountBDesired,
        uint256 amountAMin,
        uint256 amountBMin,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline
    )
```
The function calculates needed amount of tokens to get LP tokens, user will be charged with some amount of `tokenA` and `tokenB`,
which is calculated in `(amountA, amountB) = _addLiquidity(...)`
`amountA` <= `amountADesired`
`amountB` <= `amountBDesired`
So user is charged precisely by `amountA` of `tokenA` and `amountB` of `tokenB`.

`JalaMasterRouter.wrapTokensAndaddLiquidity()` and `JalaMasterRouter.wrapTokenAndaddLiquidityETH()` charge user by `amountADesired` of `tokenA` and `amountBDesired` of `tokenB`, 
and remainer sent to address `to` provided by caller.

This is unexpected and will lead to errors, because protocol took more than it needed and sent leftover to `to` address.

Same issue applies to swap function `JalaMasterRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens()`

## Impact 
Most impactful on 3rd party smart contracts, which interact with `JalaMasterRouter` and `JalaRouter02`, 
because they have their invariants and math involved, which will break in situations when `JalaRouter02` only takes precise amount of tokens needed on swap or add liquidity, but `JalaMasterRouter` takes `amountADesired` amount of tokens and transfering reminder to `to` address instead of `msg.sender`
Some contracts may work only with particualr tokens, and if we send them some unsupported tokens they will be just stuck.
For example if contract supports only LP tokens and we passed its address into `to` argument, it can expect to receive only LP tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Send remaidner to `msg.sender`

in jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaMasterRouter.sol
```diff
    function wrapTokensAndaddLiquidity(
    ...
-    _unwrapAndTransfer(wrappedTokenB, to);
-    _unwrapAndTransfer(wrappedTokenA, to);
+    _unwrapAndTransfer(wrappedTokenA, msg.sender);
+    _unwrapAndTransfer(wrappedTokenB, msg.sender);
```

```diff
    function wrapTokenAndaddLiquidityETH(
    ...
-    _unwrapAndTransfer(wrappedToken, to);
+    _unwrapAndTransfer(wrappedToken, msg.sender);
```

```diff
    function swapExactTokensForTokens(
    ...
-     (reminderTokenAddress, reminder) = _unwrapAndTransfer(path[path.length - 1], to);
+     (reminderTokenAddress, reminder) = _unwrapAndTransfer(path[path.length - 1], msg.sender);
```
