# Precision Loss Issue in `burn` Function

## Summary
The `burn` function in the `JalaPair` contract contains a potential precision loss issue in the calculation of `amount0` and `amount1`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `burn` function, the lines:

```solidity
amount0 = (liquidity * balance0) / _totalSupply;
amount1 = (liquidity * balance1) / _totalSupply;
```

attempt to calculate the amounts of `token0` and `token1` to be transferred out based on the liquidity being burned. However, this calculation may result in a precision loss due to integer division.

## Impact
The precision loss issue can lead to inaccurate token amounts being transferred out during the burning process. This may result in loss of funds for users interacting with the contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 // this low-level function should be called from a contract which performs important safety checks
 function burn(address to) external lock returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
        (uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1, ) = getReserves(); // gas savings
        address _token0 = token0; // gas savings
        address _token1 = token1; // gas savings
        uint256 balance0 = IERC20(_token0).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 balance1 = IERC20(_token1).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 liquidity = balanceOf[address(this)];

        bool feeOn = _mintFee(_reserve0, _reserve1);
        uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply; // gas savings, must be defined here since totalSupply can update in _mintFee
        amount0 = (liquidity * balance0) / _totalSupply;
        amount1 = (liquidity * balance1) / _totalSupply;
        if (amount0 == 0 || amount1 == 0) revert InsufficientLiquidityBurned();
        _burn(address(this), liquidity);
        _safeTransfer(_token0, to, amount0);
        _safeTransfer(_token1, to, amount1);
        balance0 = IERC20(_token0).balanceOf(address(this));
        balance1 = IERC20(_token1).balanceOf(address(this));

        _update(balance0, balance1, _reserve0, _reserve1);
        if (feeOn) kLast = uint256(reserve0) * reserve1; // reserve0 and reserve1 are up-to-date
        emit Burn(msg.sender, amount0, amount1, to);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `SafeMath`: Consider using `SafeMath` library or similar safe arithmetic operations to prevent precision loss during calculations.
