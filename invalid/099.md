# Swapper can empty ReserveOut with input amount of just 1wei

## Summary
Swapper can empty ReserveOut with input amount of just 1wei
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function getAmountIn(
        uint256 amountOut,
        uint256 reserveIn,
        uint256 reserveOut
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 amountIn) {
        if (amountOut == 0) revert InsufficientOutputAmount();
        if (reserveIn == 0 || reserveOut == 0) revert InsufficientLiquidity();
        uint256 numerator = reserveIn * amountOut * 1000;
>>>        uint256 denominator = (reserveOut - amountOut) * 997;
        amountIn = (numerator / denominator) + 1;
    }
```
The getAmountIn(...) function above shows how amountIn is derived by input of a certain amountOut in the Jala library, the espected amountIn should be equivalent to how much amountOut is inputted i.e low amountOut should return low amountIn and high amount Out should return high amount In. However, there is a problem, whenever the amountOut is high and exactly equal to the reserveOut, the amountIn required would be exactly just 1 wei. This is because as noted in the pointer in the code above the denominator would be zero,  as (reserveOut - amountOut) would be zero, which means the calculation of amountIn would be  `(numerator / 0 ) + 1` which is equal just 1 wei amountIn for the entire ReserveOut
## Impact
Swapper can empty reserveOut by calling the functions that call _swap(...) function using input of just 1 wei after calling getAmountIn(...) at  [L267](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaRouter02.sol#L267), [L300](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaRouter02.sol#L300) & [L341](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaRouter02.sol#L341) of JalaRouter contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Protocol should ensure denominator is never set to zero by reverting the function whenever denominator is zero to avoid contract manipulation
```solidity
    function getAmountIn(
        uint256 amountOut,
        uint256 reserveIn,
        uint256 reserveOut
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 amountIn) {
        if (amountOut == 0) revert InsufficientOutputAmount();
        if (reserveIn == 0 || reserveOut == 0) revert InsufficientLiquidity();
        uint256 numerator = reserveIn * amountOut * 1000;
        uint256 denominator = (reserveOut - amountOut) * 997;
+++   if ( denominator == 0 ) revert();
        amountIn = (numerator / denominator) + 1;
    }
```
