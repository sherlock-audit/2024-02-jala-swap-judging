# Attack Due To Rounding Error

## Summary

Rouding error attack is possible Though  dead shares have been transferred  in Address(0)

## Vulnerability Detail

- The hacker back-runs a transaction of a new pair creation.
- The hacker mints 1,000 shares: deposit(1000). Thus, totalAsset()==1000, totalSupply()==1000. Note that the balanceOf(hacker) == 0 and balanceOf(address(0)) == 1000 in this example.
- The hacker front-runs the deposit of the victim who wants to deposit 20,000 USDT (20,000.000000).
- The hacker inflates the denominator right in front of the victim: asset.transfer(20_000_000e6). Now totalAsset() == 20_000_000e6 + 1000, totalSupply() == 1000
- Next, the victim's tx takes place. The victim gets 1000 * 20_000e6 / (20_000_000e6 + 1000) == 0 shares. The victim gets zero shares, losing their deposit to the pool.
- Thus, the hacker burns any deposit of the victim, but spends a thousand times more money to do so.


## Impact

Loss of the user funds although the attacker loss his funds
