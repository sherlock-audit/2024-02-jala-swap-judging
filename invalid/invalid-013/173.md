# `JalaPair::mint` migrators can mint as much as `type(uint).max - 1` and DOS the pair contract.

## Summary
Migrators can mint as much as `type(uint).max - 1` which will lead to `totalSupply` of the pair token being at max.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is that I'm unsure if the migrators are trusted or not, but they're set in `JalaFactory::setMigrators` only by the `feeToSetter` address. Still in `JalaPair::mint` function they can mint as much as `type(uint256).max - 1` regardless of how much they've deposited:

```javascript
    function mint(address to) external lock returns (uint256 liquidity) {
        (uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1, ) = getReserves(); // gas savings
        uint256 balance0 = IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 balance1 = IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 amount0 = balance0 - _reserve0;
        uint256 amount1 = balance1 - _reserve1;

        bool feeOn = _mintFee(_reserve0, _reserve1);
        uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply; // gas savings, must be defined here since totalSupply can update in _mintFee
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            if (IJalaFactory(factory).migrators(msg.sender)) {
>>>        liquidity = IMigrator(msg.sender).desiredLiquidity();
>>>        if (liquidity == 0 || liquidity == type(uint).max) revert BadDesiredLiquidity();
            } else {
                liquidity = Math.sqrt(amount0 * amount1) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
                _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); // permanently lock the first MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY tokens
            }
        } else {
            liquidity = Math.min((amount0 * _totalSupply) / _reserve0, (amount1 * _totalSupply) / _reserve1);
        }
        if (liquidity == 0) revert InsufficientLiquidityMinted();
        _mint(to, liquidity);

        _update(balance0, balance1, _reserve0, _reserve1);
        if (feeOn) kLast = uint256(reserve0) * reserve1; // reserve0 and reserve1 are up-to-date
        emit Mint(msg.sender, amount0, amount1);
    }
```

Therefore, it poses several vulnerabilities that I lay out in the **Impact.**

## Impact
1. No one can mint the pair token -> no one can deposit in the liquidity pool for that token pair, cause the function to mint the pair token will always revert.
2. The new pool for that pair cannot be created since [`JalaFactory::createPair`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/030d3ed54214754301154bce0e58ea534100a7e3/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaFactory.sol#L46) checks if such pair already exists and reverts if so.
3. The protocol doesn't present any function to delete such pair or change the address of such pair, therefore, the entire pair of tokens can be easily DOSed by migrators.

## Code Snippet
Mint function is provided above, and other functions mentioned, contain the link to the contract :)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either set a far smaller cap for migrators or create a mechanism to delete pair/create new implementation for that pair.
