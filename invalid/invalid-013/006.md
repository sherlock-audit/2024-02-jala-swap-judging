# A malicious fellow can send 1 value of `token0` and `token1` directly into a JalaPair to make other users lose some value in the liquidity minted to them

## Summary
There's no minimum amount specified in the JalaPair that can be deposited to mint liquidity.
A Malicious fellow could send 1 value of token0 and token1 to make other users lose some value in the liquidity minted to them

This is a form of donation attack
## Vulnerability Detail
Lets take a look at `JalaPair.mint()`:
```solidity
 // this low-level function should be called from a contract which performs important safety checks
    function mint(address to) external lock returns (uint256 liquidity) {
        (uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1, ) = getReserves(); // gas savings
        uint256 balance0 = IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 balance1 = IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 amount0 = balance0 - _reserve0;
        uint256 amount1 = balance1 - _reserve1;

        bool feeOn = _mintFee(_reserve0, _reserve1);
        uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply; // gas savings, must be defined here since totalSupply can update in _mintFee
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            if (IJalaFactory(factory).migrators(msg.sender)) {
                liquidity = IMigrator(msg.sender).desiredLiquidity();
                if (liquidity == 0 || liquidity == type(uint).max) revert BadDesiredLiquidity();
            } else {
                liquidity = Math.sqrt(amount0 * amount1) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
                _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); // permanently lock the first MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY tokens
            }
        } else {
            liquidity = Math.min((amount0 * _totalSupply) / _reserve0, (amount1 * _totalSupply) / _reserve1);
        }
        if (liquidity == 0) revert InsufficientLiquidityMinted();//@audit-info this will be 0 if there's no trf of funds into contract.
        _mint(to, liquidity);

        _update(balance0, balance1, _reserve0, _reserve1);
        if (feeOn) kLast = uint256(reserve0) * reserve1; // reserve0 and reserve1 are up-to-date
        emit Mint(msg.sender, amount0, amount1);
    }
```
- The malicious fellow will send 1 value of `token0` and `token1` directly into the `JalaPair` and call `JalaPair.mint() in the same transaction. (OFC its not hard to predict the address of a JalaPair)
-  The 1 value of token0 and token1 sent into `JalaPair` will reflect in `balance0` and `balance1` which will later be updated into the reserves after liquidity is minted.
```solidity
_update(balance0, balance1, _reserve0, _reserve1);
```
- now lets say `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` was 100 before the malicious fellow did this, `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` will become 101 after he has done this and the next users who will be depositing liquidity via JalaRouter02.sol will be affected.

for example: 

-  lets say `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` was 100 and totalLiquidity is 500, users deposits 500 of token0 and token1 into the JalaPair via the JalaRouter02.sol according to the below formular
```solidity
  liquidity = Math.min((amount0 * _totalSupply) / _reserve0, (amount1 * _totalSupply) / _reserve1);
```
he will have (500 x 500 / 100 ) = 2,500 (lets just assume equal amounts of token0 and token1 has always been deposited into the JalaPair)

But if the `_reserve0` and `_reserve1` is 101 he will have 2,475  having lost 25 in liquidity due to the malicious fellows action.

This loss caused by the actions of the malicious fellow will increase depending on the amount deposited by the user and the totalSupply of the JalaPair.
## Impact
A malicious fellow can send 1 value of token0 and token1 to make other users lose some value in the liquidity minted to them

I think this can be graded as a high impact due to this loss being a significant value loss in huge deposits.. like when whales deposit and also when the JalaPair's totalSupply is large

Manual Review

## Recommendation
i think the best way to mitigate this is in `JalaPair._update()` before reserve0 and reserve1 are updated with balance0 and balance1 values, reduce them to the nearest even number just incase a malicious fellow attempts the above described attack.
```solidity
function _update(uint256 balance0, uint256 balance1, uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1) private {
        if (balance0 > type(uint112).max || balance1 > type(uint112).max) revert Overflow();
        uint32 blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp % 2 ** 32);
        uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
            // * never overflows, and + overflow is desired
            price0CumulativeLast += uint256(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve1).uqdiv(_reserve0)) * timeElapsed;
            price1CumulativeLast += uint256(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve0).uqdiv(_reserve1)) * timeElapsed;
        }
        
-       reserve0 = uint112(balance0);
-       reserve1 = uint112(balance1);

+       reserve0 = uint112(balance0 - (balance0 % 2));
+       reserve1 = uint112(balance1 - (balance1 % 2));
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }
```
