# Liquidity provided by migrator could easily overflow and brick contract

## Summary
When a new pool is created by a `migrator`, the maximum `liquidity` is `type(uint).max - 1` which could easily overflow after the first deposit is made

## Vulnerability Detail
In `mint()`, when `totalSupply == 0` and if the caller is a `migrator`, then `liquidity` will be set to whatever the `migrator` desires as long as `liquidity != 0 && liquidity != type(uint).max`. 
```solidity
if (_totalSupply == 0) {
	if (IJalaFactory(factory).migrators(msg.sender)) {
		liquidity = IMigrator(msg.sender).desiredLiquidity();
		
		//@audit liquidity should be at least minimum_liquidity otherwise donation attacks possible
		if (liquidity == 0 || liquidity == type(uint).max) revert BadDesiredLiquidity();
	} else {
		liquidity = Math.sqrt(amount0 * amount1) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
		_mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY);
	}

```

If the `liquidity` provided is less than `type(uint).max` , then the pool will be successfully created. However, if `liquidity` is large enough then the next depositor will be unable to deposit as `mint` will revert:
```solidity
else {
liquidity = Math.min((amount0 * _totalSupply) / _reserve0, (amount1 * _totalSupply) / _reserve1);
}
``` 

Essentially the check that initial liquidity is greater than 0 and less than `type(uint).max` does not make sense and the protocol should consider calculating the `liquidity` instead of letting `migrator` determine it. There are no documentation for what role `migrator` plays so it is difficult to accurately assess what risks are present.

## Impact
If `liquidity` is large enough , it will DOS further deposits into the pool due to revert in `mint` and render the pool useless.

## Recommendation
Consider adding calculations for `liquidity` or stick to the original Uniswap V2 implementation.
