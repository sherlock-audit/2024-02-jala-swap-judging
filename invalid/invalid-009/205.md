# Protocol may not work with upgradeable tokens

## Summary
Upgradeable ERC20 tokens may open up attack vectors. They may appear inert initially

## Vulnerability Detail
However when upgraded they can become ERC777 or become fee on transfer or activate a fee, become rebasing, flash mintable, enact multiple addresses etc after upgrade leading to potential incompatibility with router and opening various attack vectors

## Impact
Liquidity pool can be stolen in some ERC777 tokens when expectation was not callback tokens
Router may be incompatible with token with fees on transfer
Some malicious tokens have been observed to include malicious javascript in their name attribute, allowing attackers to extract private keys from users who choose to interact with these tokens via vulnerable frontends.

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
function addLiquidity(
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        uint256 amountADesired,
        uint256 amountBDesired,
        uint256 amountAMin,
        uint256 amountBMin,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external virtual override ensure(deadline) returns (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB, uint256 liquidity) {
        (amountA, amountB) = _addLiquidity(tokenA, tokenB, amountADesired, amountBDesired, amountAMin, amountBMin);
        address pair = JalaLibrary.pairFor(factory, tokenA, tokenB);
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(tokenA, msg.sender, pair, amountA);
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(tokenB, msg.sender, pair, amountB);
        liquidity = IJalaPair(pair).mint(to);
    }
```

```solidity 
function swapExactTokensForTokens(
        uint256 amountIn,
        uint256 amountOutMin,
        address[] calldata path,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external virtual override ensure(deadline) returns (uint256[] memory amounts) {
        amounts = JalaLibrary.getAmountsOut(factory, amountIn, path);
        if (amounts[amounts.length - 1] < amountOutMin) revert JalaLibrary.InsufficientOutputAmount();
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
            path[0],
            msg.sender,
            JalaLibrary.pairFor(factory, path[0], path[1]),
            amounts[0]
        );
        _swap(amounts, path, to);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
May be recommended to whitelist tokens and avoid upgradeable tokens
May be recommended to monitor upgradeable tokens and preempt or proactive or react to changes that may introduce fees, callbacks etc
Consider introducing logic that will freeze interactions with the token in question if an upgrade is detected.
