# `JalaMasterRouter` will not be compatible with ERC20s which do not return bool on their `approve` method

## Summary
`JalaMasterRouter` will not be compatible with ERC20s which do not return bool on their `approve` method 

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20s do not return a `bool` value on their `approve` method (e.g. USDT). Since the used interface expects a bool method to be returned, it will be impossible for the router to work with tokens that do not return any value.

```solidity
    function _approveAndWrap(address token, uint256 amount) private returns (address wrappedToken) {
        IERC20(token).approve(wrapperFactory, amount); // no need for check return value, bc addliquidity will revert if approve was declined.
        wrappedToken = IChilizWrapperFactory(wrapperFactory).wrap(address(this), token, amount);
    }
```

`safeApprove` should be used 

## Impact
Contract will not be able to work with tokens which do not return a `bool` on their `approve` method
