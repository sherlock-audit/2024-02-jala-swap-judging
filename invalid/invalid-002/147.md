# Owner is not initialized in ChilizWrapperFactory

## Summary
Owner is not set and initialized in the aforementioned contract although it inherits the ```Ownable``` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Since no features require an owner to be set, it could be argued that the owner variable not being set is not a valid bug.
But just by the ```Ownable``` contract being present in the inheritance chain - it must be taken in consideration that it has been left out unintentionally thus making a mistake.

## Impact
The contract is left without an owner which may be needed for a number of feature implementing or later functionality.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialize owner with constuctor - add following code snippet to ```ChilizWrapperFactory```.
```solidity
constructor() Ownable() {}
```
