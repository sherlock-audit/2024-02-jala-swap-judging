# Susceptibility to Slippage and Front-Running in getAmountOut and getAmountIn functions

## Summary

Both the [getAmountOut](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/libraries/JalaLibrary.sol#L71) and [getAmountIn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/libraries/JalaLibrary.sol#L85) functions calculate swap amounts based on current liquidity pool reserves.

Transactions on public blockchains are visible in the mempool before being mined, allowing attackers to observe and exploit these pending swaps. Moreover, significant trades can alter the reserve ratios, causing subsequent trades to suffer from slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following scenario:
Alice wants to swap 1,000 TokenA for TokenB.
The current reserves in the liquidity pool are 100,000 TokenA and 50,000 TokenB, giving a price ratio of 1 TokenA = 0.5 TokenB.

Alice uses the getAmountOut function to calculate how much TokenB she should receive for her 1,000 TokenA. The function applies a fee (0.3%), so the effective amount of TokenA considered for the swap is 997 TokenA.

Alice's transaction is broadcasted but waits in the mempool to be mined. The expected output, based on the reserves and her input, should be approximately 497.5 TokenB (after fees and before any potential slippage is considered).

Bob, a potential attacker, is monitoring the mempool and identifies Alice's transaction. He calculates that once Alice's swap is executed, the new price of TokenA to TokenB will shift unfavorably for subsequent swaps due to the change in reserve ratios.

Bob decides to execute a swap immediately before Alice's transaction, with a higher gas price to ensure his transaction is mined first. He swaps an amount of TokenA for TokenB that significantly alters the reserve ratio, extracting favorable terms before the reserves are impacted by Alice's transaction.

By the time Alice's transaction is mined, the reserves have been altered by Bob's transaction. The amount of TokenB she receives is significantly less than expected due to the altered reserve ratio, demonstrating both slippage and the impact of a successful front-running attack.

Before Bob's Front-Running: 1,000 TokenA = 497.5 TokenB.
After Bob's Front-Running: The price of TokenA in terms of TokenB has increased due to reduced TokenB reserves. Alice now receives lesser than expected tokens, for example, only 450 TokenB.

## Impact

These vulnerabilities could lead to users receiving significantly less output for their swaps than expected or being preempted by attackers who can exploit visible pending transactions.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// given an output amount of an asset and pair reserves, returns a required input amount of the other asset
    function getAmountIn(
        uint256 amountOut,
        uint256 reserveIn,
        uint256 reserveOut
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 amountIn) {
        if (amountOut == 0) revert InsufficientOutputAmount();
        if (reserveIn == 0 || reserveOut == 0) revert InsufficientLiquidity();
        uint256 numerator = reserveIn * amountOut * 1000;
        uint256 denominator = (reserveOut - amountOut) * 997;
        amountIn = (numerator / denominator) + 1;
    }

    // performs chained getAmountOut calculations on any number of pairs
    function getAmountsOut(
        address factory,
        uint256 amountIn,
        address[] memory path
    ) internal view returns (uint256[] memory amounts) {
        if (path.length < 2) revert InvalidPath();
        amounts = new uint256[](path.length);
        amounts[0] = amountIn;
        for (uint256 i; i < path.length - 1; i++) {
            (uint256 reserveIn, uint256 reserveOut) = getReserves(factory, path[i], path[i + 1]);
            amounts[i + 1] = getAmountOut(amounts[i], reserveIn, reserveOut);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow users to set a maximum slippage tolerance when submitting a swap transaction. If the actual slippage exceeds this tolerance, the transaction reverts, protecting the user from unfavorable rates. 

Additionally, employing a mechanism like Ethereum's EIP-1559 with a max fee and priority fee can make front-running less economically viable due to the unpredictability of transaction ordering by miners.
