# M-6 Jala ERC20 Implementation contains Non-standard IncreaseAllowance and DecreaseAllowance Methods

## Summary
ERC20 standard does not contain methods like  IncreaseAllowance and DecreaseAllowance.
## Vulnerability Detail

Oppenzeppelin initially launched their ERC20 token standard with  IncreaseAllowance and DecreaseAllowance function
But now onwards they are removing these methods because they are not part of the standard.

See the discussion here :
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/4583

## Impact

Non-Standard implementation

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/tokens/JalaERC20.sol#L68-L80

```solidity

    function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public virtual returns (bool) {
        _approve(msg.sender, spender, allowance[msg.sender][spender] + addedValue);
        return true;
    }

    function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) public virtual returns (bool) {
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance[msg.sender][spender];
        if (currentAllowance < subtractedValue) revert InvalidAllowance();
        unchecked {
            _approve(msg.sender, spender, currentAllowance - subtractedValue);
        }

        return true;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Protocol should decide with their internal Team discussion whether they want to keep these functions or not
as Tokens won't be supporting them in future.
