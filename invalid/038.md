# Protocol Insolvency and Incorrect Token Allocation due to Static Balance Representation with Rebasing Tokens

## Summary
The **depositFor** function in the smart contract is vulnerable to protocol insolvency or failure to deliver promised returns when interacting with rebasing tokens. The function mints a static **amount** of tokens to the account based on the deposited **amount** and a **decimalsOffset** without accounting for potential changes in the token's balance due to rebasing events. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability in the code lies in the line 38 where the amount is multiplied by decimalsOffset before minting the tokens to the account. This can lead to incorrect token allocation when dealing with rebasing tokens.

Rebasing tokens adjust the total supply of tokens based on a specific formula, which means the balance of tokens held by an address can change over time. By multiplying the amount by **decimalsOffset** before minting, the code assumes a static balance representation, which can result in incorrect token allocation when the total supply of tokens changes due to rebasing.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the decimalsOffset variable to mint a larger amount of tokens than the actual deposited amount. This can result in protocol insolvency as the total supply of tokens in circulation may exceed the actual amount of underlying assets held by the contract.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract ExploitContract {
    ERC20 public underlyingToken;
    uint256 public decimalsOffset = 2; // Manipulate this variable to exploit the vulnerability

    constructor(address _underlyingToken) {
        underlyingToken = ERC20(_underlyingToken);
    }

    function depositFor(address account, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
        if (address(underlyingToken) == address(0)) revert("NotInitialized");
        address sender = msg.sender;
        if (sender == address(this)) revert("CannotDeposit");
        underlyingToken.transferFrom(sender, address(this), amount);
        _mint(account, amount * decimalsOffset);

        emit Deposit(account, amount);

        return true;
    }

    function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal {
        // Mint tokens to the account
    }

    event Deposit(address indexed account, uint256 amount);
}
```
By manipulating the **decimalsOffset** variable in the **ExploitContract**, an attacker can deposit a smaller **amount** of tokens and mint a larger amount to the account, exploiting the vulnerability and potentially causing protocol insolvency.

## Impact
This could lead to a scenario where the protocol holds fewer tokens than it has obligations to fulfill if a negative rebase occurs, risking insolvency during withdrawals. Conversely, if a positive rebase occurs, the contract fails to credit the appropriate additional tokens to users, resulting in incorrect token representation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code lies in line 38 where the amount is multiplied by **decimalsOffset** before minting the tokens to the account. This can lead to incorrect token allocation when dealing with rebasing tokens, as the balance of the account will be represented in a static value while the token supply changes due to rebasing.

To fix this issue, the multiplication by decimalsOffset should be done after the token amount has been minted to the account. This way, the correct **amount** of tokens will be minted based on the current token supply.

Here is the patched code example:

```solidity
33       function depositFor(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
34           if (address(underlyingToken) == address(0)) revert NotInitialized();
35           address sender = _msgSender();
36           if (sender == address(this)) revert CannotDeposit();
37           SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(underlyingToken, sender, address(this), amount);
38           _mint(account, amount);
39           _mint(account, amount * decimalsOffset);
40   
41           emit Deposit(account, amount);
42   
43           return true;
```
