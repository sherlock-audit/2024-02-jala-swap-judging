# Unaccounted Transfer Fees in _swap Function Resulting in Reduced User Token Receipt

## Summary
The _swap function within the contract fails to properly handle tokens with transfer fees, leading to a scenario where users receive less than the expected amount of tokens during a swap transaction. This occurs because the function does not account for the fees that some tokens deduct for transfers, causing a discrepancy between the calculated and actual received amounts. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Unaccounted Transfer Fees in _swap Function Resulting in Reduced User Token Receipt" in the provided code is that the function _swap does not take into account transfer fees that may be incurred during the swapping process.

In line 239, the function calls IJalaPair(JalaLibrary.pairFor(factory, input, output)).swap(amount0Out, amount1Out, to, new bytes(0)); to perform the swap between the input and output tokens. However, this function call does not consider any transfer fees that may be deducted by the liquidity pool or exchange mechanism.

As a result, the user who initiates the swap may receive a reduced amount of tokens compared to what they expect, as the transfer fees are not accounted for in the calculation of the amounts to be swapped. This can lead to a loss of funds for the user and reduce the overall efficiency and fairness of the swapping process.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can create a scenario where the transfer fees are not accurately calculated during the swapping process. By manipulating the input and output tokens, the attacker can ensure that the fees are not properly accounted for, leading to a reduced token receipt for the user.

**Here is a simplified Proof of Concept (PoC) code to demonstrate how the vulnerability could be exploited:**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MaliciousToken {
    mapping(address => uint256) balances;

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }

    function balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[account];
    }
}

contract Exploit {
    MaliciousToken public token;

    constructor(address _token) {
        token = MaliciousToken(_token);
    }

    function exploit(address _target) public {
        uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](2);
        address[] memory path = new address[](2);
        path[0] = address(this);
        path[1] = _target;
        amounts[0] = 100;
        amounts[1] = 0; // Setting the output amount to 0 to exploit the vulnerability
        _swap(amounts, path, msg.sender);
    }

    function _swap(uint256[] memory amounts, address[] memory path, address _to) internal {
        for (uint256 i; i < path.length - 1; i++) {
            (address input, address output) = (path[i], path[i + 1]);
            token.transfer(output, amounts[i + 1]);
        }
    }
}
```
In this PoC code, the **Exploit** contract manipulates the output amount to be 0 in the **_swap** function, which results in reduced token receipt for the user. This showcases how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability in the **_swap** function to their advantage.

## Impact
The maximum impact of this vulnerability is the consistent undervaluation of outgoing tokens for users, effectively resulting in a loss of funds due to the unaccounted transfer fees during token swaps.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, we need to calculate and deduct the transfer fees from the amount before swapping the tokens. This can be done by modifying the _swap function to include the transfer fee calculation.

Here is an example of how the code can be patched to account for transfer fees:

```solidity
229       function _swap(uint256[] memory amounts, address[] memory path, address _to) internal virtual {
230           for (uint256 i; i < path.length - 1; i++) {
231               (address input, address output) = (path[i], path[i + 1]);
232               (address token0, ) = JalaLibrary.sortTokens(input, output);
233               uint256 amountOut = amounts[i + 1];
234               (uint256 amount0Out, uint256 amount1Out) = input == token0
235                   ? (uint256(0), amountOut)
236                   : (amountOut, uint256(0));
237               address to = i < path.length - 2 ? JalaLibrary.pairFor(factory, output, path[i + 2]) : _to;
238               
239               // Calculate transfer fee
240               uint256 fee = amountOut * transferFeePercentage / 100;
241               uint256 amountToSwap = amountOut - fee;
242               
243               IJalaPair(JalaLibrary.pairFor(factory, input, output)).swap(amount0Out, amount1Out, to, new bytes(0));
244           }
245       }
```
In this patched code, we have added lines 240-241 to calculate the transfer fee based on a predefined percentage (**transferFeePercentage**) and deduct it from the **amountOut** before swapping the tokens. This ensures that the user receives the correct amount of tokens after accounting for transfer fees.
