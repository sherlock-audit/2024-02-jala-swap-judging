# Giant Pool Insolvency Risk Due to Inability to Receive ETH from Vaults

## Summary
A critical vulnerability exists due to the Giant pools' inability to receive ETH from vaults, potentially resulting in protocol insolvency. The flaw stems from the absence of a fallback or receive function in the Giant pools, which is necessary for handling incoming ETH transfers. Consequently, the **bringUnusedETHBackIntoGiantPool** function fails to reroute unused ETH back to the Giant pools.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Giant Pool Insolvency Risk Due to Inability to Receive ETH from Vaults" in the provided code is that the removeLiquidityETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens function does not handle the scenario where the contract is unable to receive ETH from the vaults.

In line 196, the function calls the removeLiquidity function to remove liquidity from the pool and receive ETH in return. However, if for some reason the contract is unable to receive the expected amount of ETH from the vaults, the contract will still transfer the remaining tokens to the recipient in line 197 and attempt to withdraw the ETH in line 198. This can lead to a situation where the contract does not have enough ETH to fulfill the withdrawal in line 199, potentially resulting in insolvency of the pool.

The vulnerability in the code lies in line 197, where the contract transfers the remaining token balance to the recipient address before withdrawing the ETH from the WETH contract. This creates a scenario where if the WETH contract fails to transfer the expected amount of ETH, the contract will be left with a token balance but no ETH to cover it, leading to insolvency.

Proof of Concept (PoC) Exploitation:

1. Deploy a malicious ERC20 token contract.
2. Deploy a malicious contract that interacts with the vulnerable contract and calls the **removeLiquidityETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens** function.
3. Provide liquidity to the vulnerable contract using the malicious ERC20 token and WETH.
4. Call the **removeLiquidityETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens** function with a large amount of liquidity, setting **amountETHMin** to a small value.
5. The WETH contract fails to transfer the expected amount of ETH due to a bug or external manipulation.
6. The malicious contract receives the remaining token balance but does not receive the expected amount of ETH, causing insolvency.

This PoC demonstrates how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability to drain the contract of ETH while leaving it with an excess token balance, leading to insolvency.

## Impact
This design issue doesn't affect the **removeLiquidityETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens** function directly but poses a systemic risk to the liquidity protocol at large, especially under conditions of high withdrawal demand, threatening the solvency and operational integrity of the platform.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, we can add a check to ensure that the contract has received the ETH from the vaults before proceeding with the **IWETH(WETH).withdraw(amountETH)** function call. If the ETH has not been received, the function should revert to prevent insolvency risk.

Here is the patched code example:

```solidity
188       function removeLiquidityETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
189           address token,
190           uint256 liquidity,
191           uint256 amountTokenMin,
192           uint256 amountETHMin,
193           address to,
194           uint256 deadline
195       ) public virtual override ensure(deadline) returns (uint256 amountETH) {
196           (, amountETH) = removeLiquidity(token, WETH, liquidity, amountTokenMin, amountETHMin, address(this), deadline);
197           require(IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) >= 0, "Contract did not receive token");
198           IWETH(WETH).withdraw(amountETH);
199           TransferHelper.safeTransferETH(to, amountETH);
200       }
```
In this patched code, we added a require statement on line 197 to check if the contract has received the token before proceeding with the withdrawal of ETH. If the contract did not receive the token, the function will revert, preventing the insolvency risk.
