# safeTransfer function does not check for existence of ERC20 token contract

## Summary
safeTransfer function does not check for existence of ERC20 token contract

## Vulnerability Detail
The safeTransfer function is a basic function used by other smart contract like:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaRouter02.sol#L197
The safeTransfer function does not check for the existence of the ERC20 token contract , TransferHelper.sol performs a transfer with a low-level call without confirming the contractâ€™s existence

The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.

It allows malicious people to pair with a qualified token like ETH with [dubious] tokens that they can destroy later, and most importantly, to run the safeTransfer function even if the token contract is later destroyed.

POC:

1 Alice creates a pair of A and B Tokens (For exampleETH - TestToken Pair).

The creator and only owner of TestToken is Alice.

2 Next, Alice destroys the TestToken with a Selfdestruct based on onlyowner privilege.

3 Bob, unaware of this, deposits ETH into the pool to trade from the ETH-TestToken pair, but cannot receive any tokens because safeTransfer does not check for the existence of the contract.

## Impact
Money loss

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function safeTransfer(
    address token,
    address to,
    uint256 value
) internal {
    // bytes4(keccak256(bytes('transfer(address,uint256)')));
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(0xa9059cbb, to, value));
    if (!success || (data.length != 0 && !abi.decode(data, (bool)))) revert TransferFailed();
}
function removeLiquidityETH(
    address token,
    uint256 liquidity,
    uint256 amountTokenMin,
    uint256 amountETHMin,
    address to,
    uint256 deadline
) public virtual override ensure(deadline) returns (uint256 amountToken, uint256 amountETH) {
    (amountToken, amountETH) = removeLiquidity(
        token,
        WETH,
        liquidity,
        amountTokenMin,
        amountETHMin,
        address(this),
        deadline
    );
    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, to, amountToken);
    IWETH(WETH).withdraw(amountETH);
    TransferHelper.safeTransferETH(to, amountETH);
}
function removeLiquidityETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
    address token,
    uint256 liquidity,
    uint256 amountTokenMin,
    uint256 amountETHMin,
    address to,
    uint256 deadline
) public virtual override ensure(deadline) returns (uint256 amountETH) {
    (, amountETH) = removeLiquidity(token, WETH, liquidity, amountTokenMin, amountETHMin, address(this), deadline);
    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, to, IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)));
    IWETH(WETH).withdraw(amountETH);
    TransferHelper.safeTransferETH(to, amountETH);
}
if (IERC20(wrappedTokenOut).balanceOf(address(this)) > 0) {
    reminderTokenAddress = address(wrappedTokenOut);
    reminder = IERC20(wrappedTokenOut).balanceOf(address(this));
    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(wrappedTokenOut, to, IERC20(wrappedTokenOut).balanceOf(address(this)));
}
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Have the SafeTransfer function check the existence of the contract before every transaction.
