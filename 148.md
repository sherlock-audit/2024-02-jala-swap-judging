# ChilizWrappedERC20 contracts can not be initialized because of a faulty check in ```initialize``` function

## Summary
```ChilizWrappedERC20``` contract has a faulty check in its' ```initialize``` function. If statement is basically demanding that the ```_underlyingToken``` argument is an address zero which makes no sense and deems the protocol useless.

## Vulnerability Detail
If statement check in initialize function is nonsensical and breaks the protocol usage.

## Impact
No ```ChilizWrappedERC20``` token can be initialized because none of them have address zero as a underlying token.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the if statement to check for zero addresses to following:
```solidity
if (address(underlyingToken) == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
```
