# Potential Fund Freezing Due to Improper Handling of Zero Liquidity Removal in Smart Contract

## Summary
A vulnerability exists in the **removeLiquidityWithPermit** function, where the function could inadvertently cause user funds to be frozen within the smart contract. This occurs due to the function's lack of handling for an edge case where the **removeLiquidity** call returns LP tokens instead of the expected underlying assets (**tokenA** and **tokenB**).
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability "Potential Fund Freezing Due to Improper Handling of Zero Liquidity Removal in Smart Contract" in the provided code is that the removeLiquidityWithPermit function does not handle the scenario where the liquidity parameter is zero properly.

In line 164, the code sets the value variable to type(uint).max if approveMax is true, otherwise it sets it to the value of liquidity. However, if liquidity is zero and approveMax is false, the value will also be zero. This can lead to potential fund freezing as the IJalaPair(pair).permit function may not handle zero values correctly and could potentially lock up funds in the smart contract.

The vulnerability in the provided code lies in the removeLiquidityWithPermit function, specifically in the way it handles zero liquidity removal. If a user attempts to remove zero liquidity from the pair, the function will still execute the removeLiquidity function, potentially resulting in the freezing of funds.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) :**

1. Deploy a malicious contract that interacts with the vulnerable smart contract.
2. Call the **removeLiquidityWithPermit** function with zero liquidity, triggering the **removeLiquidity** function.
3. As the **removeLiquidity** function will still execute, it may result in the freezing of funds in the pair.

This exploit takes advantage of the improper handling of zero liquidity removal in the smart contract, potentially leading to fund freezing.
## Impact
 If this condition is triggered, the user's LP tokens could become irretrievable as the contract does not have the mechanism to return these tokens to the user, leading to a potential permanent loss of liquidity for the user.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, we need to add a check to ensure that the liquidity parameter is greater than zero before setting the value variable. If the liquidity is zero, we can revert the transaction with an error message.

Here is the corresponding patch code example:

```solidity
150       function removeLiquidityWithPermit(
151           address tokenA,
152           address tokenB,
153           uint256 liquidity,
154           uint256 amountAMin,
155           uint256 amountBMin,
156           address to,
157           uint256 deadline,
158           bool approveMax,
159           uint8 v,
160           bytes32 r,
161           bytes32 s
162       ) external virtual override returns (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) {
163           require(liquidity > 0, "Cannot remove zero liquidity");
164           address pair = JalaLibrary.pairFor(factory, tokenA, tokenB);
165           uint256 value = approveMax ? type(uint).max : liquidity;
166           IJalaPair(pair).permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s);
167           (amountA, amountB) = removeLiquidity(tokenA, tokenB, liquidity, amountAMin, amountBMin, to, deadline);
168       }
```
By adding the **require(liquidity > 0, "Cannot remove zero liquidity"**); check on line 163, we ensure that the liquidity parameter is greater than zero before proceeding with the function execution. This prevents the fund freezing issue caused by improper handling of zero liquidity removal in the smart contract.
