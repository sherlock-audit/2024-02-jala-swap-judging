# Unbounded array can provoke a DoS attack

## Summary
Unbounded address array `JalaFactory::allPairs` can grow indefinitely, allowing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `JalaFactory::createPair` function, the address if the new pair contract is pushed into `allPairs` array. There is no limitation or bound to how much can this array grow. This can potentially lead to a DoS attack.

## Impact
Unables the creation of new pair contracts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a mapping (`mapping(address => mapping(address => address))`) and a `uint` variable to store the total amount of pairs instead, since the index of `JalaFactory::allPairs` is never used.
