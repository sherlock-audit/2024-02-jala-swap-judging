# Lack of Precision Control in Token Wrapping and Unwrapping

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the lack of precision control during token wrapping and unwrapping operations within the contract. Specifically, the issue arises from instances where division occurs before multiplication, potentially leading to precision loss when dealing with tokens with varying decimal places.

Let's delve into one of the vulnerable sections of the contract for a detailed explanation:
```solidity
function _unwrapAndTransfer(
    address wrappedTokenOut,
    address to
) private returns (address reminderTokenAddress, uint256 reminder) {
    uint256 balanceOut = IERC20(wrappedTokenOut).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (balanceOut == 0) return (reminderTokenAddress, reminder);

    uint256 tokenOutOffset = IChilizWrappedERC20(wrappedTokenOut).getDecimalsOffset();
    uint256 tokenOutReturnAmount = (balanceOut / tokenOutOffset) * tokenOutOffset;

    IERC20(wrappedTokenOut).approve(wrapperFactory, tokenOutReturnAmount);

    if (tokenOutReturnAmount > 0) {
        IChilizWrapperFactory(wrapperFactory).unwrap(to, wrappedTokenOut, tokenOutReturnAmount);
    }

    // Transfer remaining dust as wrapped token
    if (IERC20(wrappedTokenOut).balanceOf(address(this)) > 0) {
        reminderTokenAddress = address(wrappedTokenOut);
        reminder = IERC20(wrappedTokenOut).balanceOf(address(this));
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(wrappedTokenOut, to, IERC20(wrappedTokenOut).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
}
```
In the `_unwrapAndTransfer()` function, the vulnerability becomes apparent in the line:
```solidity
uint256 tokenOutReturnAmount = (balanceOut / tokenOutOffset) * tokenOutOffset;
```
Here, `balanceOut`, representing the balance of the wrapped token, is divided by `tokenOutOffset` before being multiplied by `tokenOutOffset`. This sequence of operations poses a risk of precision loss if `tokenOutOffset` is not a power of 10.

To further elaborate:
- `balanceOut` holds the balance of the wrapped token in the contract.
- `tokenOutOffset` represents the offset or decimal precision of the wrapped token.
- The intention of the code is to calculate `tokenOutReturnAmount`, the amount of token to be unwrapped and transferred.
- However, dividing `balanceOut` by `tokenOutOffset` before multiplying by `tokenOutOffset` can result in precision loss, particularly if `tokenOutOffset` is not a multiple of 10.
For instance, if `tokenOutOffset` is 100 (equivalent to two decimal places), dividing `balanceOut` by 100 before multiplying by 100 can lead to truncation of decimal values, causing inaccuracies in the unwrapping process.

## Impact
This vulnerability could potentially result in incorrect token amounts being unwrapped and transferred, leading to financial discrepancies for users interacting with the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Perform multiplication before division to maintain accuracy. Additionally, using fixed-point arithmetic libraries or converting token amounts to standardized units before performing calculations can help mitigate precision issues when dealing with tokens with varying decimal places.
