# Slippage protection will not work when removing liquidity through JalaMasterRouter

## Summary
Inside `JalaMasterRouter::removeLiquidityAndUnwrapToken`  after the swap happens additional calculations are made that further reduce the received amount (because of rounding down). However there is no check if the final amount to receive is below the specified minimum. As a result users will experience losses

## Vulnerability Detail
This is how  `JalaMasterRouter::removeLiquidityAndUnwrapToken` works:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaMasterRouter.sol#L101
```solidity
function removeLiquidityAndUnwrapToken(
        address tokenA, // token origin addr
        address tokenB,
        uint256 liquidity,
        uint256 amountAMin,
        uint256 amountBMin,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external virtual override returns (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) {
        ....

        (amountA, amountB) = IJalaRouter02(router).removeLiquidity(
            wrappedTokenA,
            wrappedTokenB,
            liquidity,
            amountAMin,
            amountBMin,
            address(this),
            deadline
        );

        uint256 tokenAOffset = IChilizWrappedERC20(wrappedTokenA).getDecimalsOffset();
        uint256 tokenBOffset = IChilizWrappedERC20(wrappedTokenB).getDecimalsOffset();
        
        uint256 tokenAReturnAmount = (amountA / tokenAOffset) * tokenAOffset;  //@audit -> division before multiplication
        uint256 tokenBReturnAmount = (amountB / tokenBOffset) * tokenBOffset;
          
        ....
        // NO check is made if returnAmount < amountAMin

        if (tokenAReturnAmount > 0) {
            IChilizWrapperFactory(wrapperFactory).unwrap(to, wrappedTokenA, tokenAReturnAmount);
        }
        if (tokenBReturnAmount > 0) {
            IChilizWrapperFactory(wrapperFactory).unwrap(to, wrappedTokenB, tokenBReturnAmount);
        }

        // transfer dust as wrapped token
        if (amountA - tokenAReturnAmount > 0) {
            TransferHelper.safeTransfer(wrappedTokenA, to, amountA - tokenAReturnAmount);
        }
        if (amountB - tokenBReturnAmount > 0) {
            TransferHelper.safeTransfer(wrappedTokenB, to, amountB - tokenBReturnAmount);
        }
    }
```
There are two problems in that code that contribute to the bug:
- The first one is that division before multiplication is used when calculating the final amounts for `tokenAReturnAmount` & `tokenBReturnAmount `. This leads to rounding down and loss of value.
- The second one is that there is no check applied after that to ensure that  `amountAMin >= tokenAReturnAmount && amountBMin>=tokenBReturnAmount `. Effectively the slippage protection does not work.

Here is a short example of the bug:
1. suppose pool exists with  wrapped `A tokens` & `B tokens` - underlying tokens each have 2 decimals 
2. the market value of a full wrapped token (1e18) is significant, so `alice` decides she wants to remove only a fraction of each token  from the pool
3. `alice ` calls  `removeLiquidityAndUnwrapToken` providing the appropriate liquidity and setting  `amountAMin` & `amountBMin` to `0.009e18` (9e15)
4. The call to the underlying router is successful and `0.009e18` amounts of each token are taken out
5. One more transformation is made on the amounts, before unwrapping. And this is where loss of value happens
 -  `(amountA / tokenAOffset) * tokenAOffset` => (9e15 /1e16) * 1e16 = 0
 -  `(amountA / tokenAOffset) * tokenAOffset` => (9e15 /1e16) * 1e16 = 0
6. But since there is no check with the provided minAmounts, the transaction will not revert and user will receive 0 amounts, while getting his LP tokens burned

## Impact
User can loose assets because slippage protection is not applied correctly and division before multiplication is used to calculate the return amount.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is a general rule in Solidity that division should always come after multiplication. Refactor the calculations inside `removeLiquidityAndUnwrapToken` & `removeLiquidityETHAndUnwrap` like so:

```solidity
// inside removeLiquidityAndUnwrapToken

 uint256 tokenAReturnAmount = (amountA  * tokenAOffset)/ tokenAOffset;
 uint256 tokenBReturnAmount = (amountB * tokenBOffset) / tokenBOffset;

// Inside removeLiquidityETHAndUnwrap
 uint256 tokenReturnAmount = (amountToken * tokenOffset) / tokenOffset;

```

Also add a slippage check  before unwrapping in both functions to ensure they revert and prevent user loss of funds:

```solidity
require( amountTokenMin >= tokenReturnAmount, "Not enough tokens received")
```

Additionally  the pattern exists in the `_unwrapAndTransfer()` function as well, so it makes sense to also fix it there:
