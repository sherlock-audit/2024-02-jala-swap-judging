# Permit call may be frontrun by attacker

## Summary
`permit` calls can be frontrun by an attacker, resulting in DOS and a poor user experience

## Vulnerability Detail
Router contracts have multiple permit functions which call `IJalaPair(pair).permit()`. An attacker could observe a user submitting this transaction and front-run it, taking the signature and calling `pair.permit()` independently for the user.

Since the signature is valid, the token will accept it and increase the nonce for the user. Then when the user's transaction is mined, it will fail due to an incorrect nonce and the entire transaction will revert.

```solidity
function removeLiquidityETHWithPermit(
        address token,
        uint256 liquidity,
        uint256 amountTokenMin,
        uint256 amountETHMin,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline,
        bool approveMax,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external virtual override returns (uint256 amountToken, uint256 amountETH) {
        address pair = JalaLibrary.pairFor(factory, token, WETH);
        uint256 value = approveMax ? type(uint).max : liquidity;
        
        //@audit can be front-run by an attacker
        IJalaPair(pair).permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s);
        (amountToken, amountETH) = removeLiquidityETH(token, liquidity, amountTokenMin, amountETHMin, to, deadline);
    }
```

## Impact
User's transaction will revert and result in DOS.

## Recommendation
Wrap the permit call in try/catch as recommended by OpenZeppelin [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20Permit:~:text=the%20use%20of-,try/catch,-allows%20the%20permit).
