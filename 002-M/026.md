# Adversary could grief DOS `removeLiquidityWithPermit` method by front-running the `permit` call

## Summary
Adversary could grief DOS `removeLiquidityWithPermit` method by front-running the `permit` call

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the `JalaRouter02`, users can remove liquidity by providing a `permit` signature, instead of having to pre-approve the contract prior to the call. 
```solidity
    function removeLiquidityWithPermit(
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        uint256 liquidity,
        uint256 amountAMin,
        uint256 amountBMin,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline,
        bool approveMax,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external virtual override returns (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) {
        address pair = JalaLibrary.pairFor(factory, tokenA, tokenB);
        uint256 value = approveMax ? type(uint).max : liquidity;
        IJalaPair(pair).permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s);
        (amountA, amountB) = removeLiquidity(tokenA, tokenB, liquidity, amountAMin, amountBMin, to, deadline);
    }
```

The problem is that any user could grief other innocent users and front-run their transactions and call `permit` with the same parameters. This would then cause the innocent user's `removeLiquidityWithPermit` to revert, as the permit signature will already have been used.

Note: the current code lacks a `permit` function within `JalaERC20`, but is supposed to have it (based on `JalaRouter02` behavior).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
if the permit fails, check if the user has enough outstanding allowance and proceed with the tx
