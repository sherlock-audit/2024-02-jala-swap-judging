# Functions using permit scheme can be DoSed

## Summary
Functions using permit can be DoSed

## Vulnerability Detail
Protocol uses offchain signatures for permit and functions relying on it can be frontrun by calling ERC20.permit. Since nonce is a part of signature and is increased on every `permit` call the signature will become invalid making removeLiquidityWithPermit* useless. 

## Impact
removeLiquidityWithPermit* will be bricked

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use try catch to prevent DoS.
