# JalaRouter02.sol - Any call to permit is front runnable, which will cause a DoS

## Summary
Any call to permit is front runnable, which will cause a DoS

## Vulnerability Detail
[Here](https://www.trust-security.xyz/post/permission-denied) is a very popular article about this vulnerability. Note that it was reported to UniswapV2 and it was rewarded.

Let's take a look at `removeLiquidityWithPermit`
```solidity
function removeLiquidityWithPermit(
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        uint256 liquidity,
        uint256 amountAMin,
        uint256 amountBMin,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline,
        bool approveMax,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external virtual override returns (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) {
        address pair = JalaLibrary.pairFor(factory, tokenA, tokenB);
        uint256 value = approveMax ? type(uint).max : liquidity;
->     IJalaPair(pair).permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s);
        (amountA, amountB) = removeLiquidity(tokenA, tokenB, liquidity, amountAMin, amountBMin, to, deadline);
    }
```

You can see that after `permit` we call `removeLiquidity`. If `permit` reverts, `removeLiquidity` cannot be called, causing a DoS attack.

To DoS someone calling any of the functions that use `permit` inside `JalaRouter02` is very easy, the attacker front runs the tx and call `permit` directly with the same parameters. Now the victim's tx will revert, since you can't permit twice with the same parameters and same nonce.


## Impact
An attacker can DoS any tx that uses `permit` to DoS users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Wrap the `permit` in a try/catch. The linked article recommends the same.
