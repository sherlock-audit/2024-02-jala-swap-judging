# Functions with permit functionallity can be greived ( DOS )

## Summary

The vulnerability lies within the removeLiquidityWithPermit function and other functions with permit where attacker fronttun and uses signature of users and greif the user transaction

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability stems from the mechanism employed by ERC20Permit, which utilizes nonces for replay protection. After successful verification and approval of a signature, the nonce increments, rendering any attempts to replay the same signature invalid.

In the removeLiquidityWithPermit function, users are expected to sign their tokens and provide the signature within the permitData. However, during the transaction mempool phase, an attacker can intercept this signature and invoke the permit function on the token themselves. Since the signature is valid, the token accepts it, thereby incrementing the nonce. Consequently, when the spender's transaction is eventually mined, it fails due to the incremented nonce.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it enables an attacker to systematically ensure the failure of all calls to removeLiquidityWithPermit upon their initial execution. Although incorporating a private RPC adds an additional layer of security and employing fallback loops can mitigate potential issues, user funds were fortunately not at risk.

Difficulty to Exploit: Easy

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use try and catch method, so if attacker have already intercepted the signature then it should not give error and it should go in catch block and there it should be easily able to remove his liquidity

Also another approach ,it is recommended to enhance the removeLiquidityWithPermit function with a check to ensure it has the necessary approval. If approval is lacking, only then should the permit signature be submitted.
