# Potential for Rounding Exploit in Fee Distribution Mechanism

## Summary
The `_mintFee` function is designed to mint fee tokens when there is an increase in the liquidity pool's size, as indicated by an increase in the square root of the product of reserves (`rootK`). Due to Solidity's integer arithmetic, which rounds down to the nearest whole number, an attacker could exploit this by making small, calculated increases in liquidity that do not increment the integer value of `rootK`. This would prevent the minting of fee tokens despite an actual increase in liquidity.

## Vulnerability Detail
### Scenario 
If `kLast` = 1000000000000
if the product of `reserve0 ` and `reserve1`  = 1000001000000
`rootkLast` which is the square root of `kLast` will give  1000000
Also the square root product of `reserve0 ` and `reserve1`  will give 1000000.4999998750000624999609375273437294922036132681579698943999061664562155263485912029229154334172164852914444157891385712586969948980838303044287691584829199553015889909356218318270764086904799578.

But  solidity truncates it too 1000000.

Now  `rootkLast` = `kLast` ;
which makes the numerator -0;
```solidity
uint256 numerator = totalSupply * (rootK - rootKLast); 
```
```solidity
uint256 liquidity = numerator / denominator;
```
consequently making the `liquidity` equals 0
since we have ` liquidity = 0/denominator , which will give 0;

and this part of the code will not be executed

```solidity
  if (liquidity > 0) _mint(feeTo, liquidity);
```

## Impact
This exploit allows an attacker to continually add liquidity and benefit from pool fees without triggering the minting of fee tokens. Over time, this could result in a significant loss of fees that should have been distributed to the fee recipient, undermining the economic incentives of the liquidity pool.
## Code Snippet
[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/main/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaPair.sol#L109-#L129)

```solidity

 // if fee is on, mint liquidity equivalent to 1/2th of the growth in sqrt(k)
    function _mintFee(uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1) private returns (bool feeOn) {
        address feeTo = IJalaFactory(factory).feeTo(); // get feeTo address
        feeOn = feeTo != address(0);
        uint256 _kLast = kLast; // gas savings
        if (feeOn) {
            if (_kLast != 0) {
                uint256 rootK = Math.sqrt(uint256(_reserve0) * _reserve1);
                uint256 rootKLast = Math.sqrt(_kLast);
                if (rootK > rootKLast) {
                    uint256 numerator = totalSupply * (rootK - rootKLast);
                    uint256 denominator = rootK + rootKLast;
                    uint256 liquidity = numerator / denominator;
                    // distribute LP fee
                    if (liquidity > 0) _mint(feeTo, liquidity);
                }
            }
        } else if (_kLast != 0) {
            kLast = 0;
        }
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1.) **Minimum Threshold Implementation:** Introduce a minimum threshold for liquidity additions that would ensure a change in rootK and trigger fee distribution. This would prevent attackers from exploiting the rounding issue.

2.) **Fee Accounting Upgrade**: Modify the fee accounting mechanism to track the exact increase in liquidity, possibly using a more granular unit of account or an accumulator that can capture small increments over time.
