# JalaPair.sol#_mintFee() - `feeOn` is true by default and the function will mint LP tokens to the DEAD address

## Summary
`feeOn` is true by default and the function will mint LP tokens to the DEAD address

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside the constructor for `JalaFactory` you can see that `feeTo` is set to the `DEAD` address by default.
```solidity
constructor(address _feeToSetter) {
        feeToSetter = _feeToSetter;
        flashOn = false;
        feeTo = DEAD;
    }
```

If we take a look at where `feeTo` is used, we find `_mintFee` inside `JalaPair`
```solidity
 function _mintFee(uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1) private returns (bool feeOn) {
        address feeTo = IJalaFactory(factory).feeTo(); // get feeTo address
        feeOn = feeTo != address(0);
        uint256 _kLast = kLast; // gas savings
        if (feeOn) {
            if (_kLast != 0) {
                uint256 rootK = Math.sqrt(uint256(_reserve0) * _reserve1);
                uint256 rootKLast = Math.sqrt(_kLast);
                if (rootK > rootKLast) {
                    uint256 numerator = totalSupply * (rootK - rootKLast);
                    uint256 denominator = rootK + rootKLast;
                    uint256 liquidity = numerator / denominator;
                    // distribute LP fee
                    if (liquidity > 0) _mint(feeTo, liquidity);
                }
            }
        } else if (_kLast != 0) {
            kLast = 0;
        }
    }
```

The function mints a small amount of LP tokens to `feeTo`.

To know if the fee is enabled, `feeOn` is used
```solidity
address feeTo = IJalaFactory(factory).feeTo(); // get feeTo address
feeOn = feeTo != address(0);
```

The problem here is that `feeTo` by default is set to `DEAD`, which isn't any protocol held address.
Because `feeTo` is checked against `address(0)`, by default `feeOn = true`, because whenever the `JalaFactory` is deployed, `feeTo` is set to `DEAD` not to address(0).

## Impact
Loss of funds for the protocol, as fees will be minted to the incorrect address.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change `feeOn = feeTo != address(0);` to `feeOn = feeTo != IJalaFactory(factory).DEAD());` or entirely remove the DEAD constant and leave `feeTo` to address(0).
