# `JalaPair::_mintFee` incorrect check for `feeTo` address leads to minting unecessary fees

## Summary
In `JalaPair::_mintFee` we get the `feeTo` address from JalaFactory contract to send fees to the protocol. And if `feeTo != address(0)`, then we mint fees, even tho the fee address is dead.

## Vulnerability Detail
Initially in `JalaFactory` the `feeTo` address is set to [`DEAD`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/030d3ed54214754301154bce0e58ea534100a7e3/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaFactory.sol#L12), so there is not actual fee address to accrue fees. But the `JalaPair::_mintFee` checks if [`feeTo != address(0)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/030d3ed54214754301154bce0e58ea534100a7e3/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaPair.sol#L111), therefore, we still mint pair tokens to the fee address. The problem is that it leads to arificially inflating the pair token's `totalSupply` due to minting excess tokens to the `DEAD` fee address, which is obviously not controlled. 

The problem is that `JalaPair::_mintFee` is called on every mint and burn of the pair token, which means that on every deposit or withdraw from the liquidity pool, excess tokens will be minted to the `DEAD` address.

## Impact
The pair token's `totalSupply` will continually inflate leading to users get less tokens when withdrawing from the liquidity pool. The problem is in `JalaPair::burn` cause on [L195-196](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-jala-swap/blob/030d3ed54214754301154bce0e58ea534100a7e3/jalaswap-dex-contract/contracts/JalaPair.sol#L195C1-L196C105) when we calculate the amount of tokens to return to the user, we use `totalSupply` as the denominator. Therefore, cause it continually inflates, the amount to be withdrawn will be far less than the user deposited (more than impermanent loss and longer the user keeps tokens in the pool, the more he loses in the end).

## Code Snippet
<details>
<summary>`JalaPair::_mintFee`</summary>

```javascript
    function _mintFee(uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1) private returns (bool feeOn) {
        address feeTo = IJalaFactory(factory).feeTo(); // get feeTo address
        feeOn = feeTo != address(0);
        uint256 _kLast = kLast; // gas savings
        if (feeOn) {
            if (_kLast != 0) {
                uint256 rootK = Math.sqrt(uint256(_reserve0) * _reserve1);
                uint256 rootKLast = Math.sqrt(_kLast);
                if (rootK > rootKLast) {
                    uint256 numerator = totalSupply * (rootK - rootKLast);
                    uint256 denominator = rootK + rootKLast;
                    uint256 liquidity = numerator / denominator;
                    // distribute LP fee
                    if (liquidity > 0) _mint(feeTo, liquidity);
                }
            }
        } else if (_kLast != 0) {
            kLast = 0;
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either just add the check that address is not dead (and have two checks) or you can remove the address(0) check, cause initially it won't be zero and we can assume the `feeToSetter` will not set `feeTo` address to 0:
```diff
        address feeTo = IJalaFactory(factory).feeTo(); // get feeTo address
+       if (feeTo != address(0) & feeTo != IJalaFactory(factory).DEAD() {
                feeOn - true;
 -      feeOn = feeTo != address(0);
 ```
