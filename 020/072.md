# Wrong Implementation of Deadline Modifier

## Summary
Wrong Implementation of Deadline as functions would be callable even at deadline
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    modifier ensure(uint256 deadline) {
>>>        if (deadline < block.timestamp) revert Expired();
        _;
    }
```
The function above shows how ensure(...) modifier is implemented in the JalaRouter02.sol contract, the modifier helps to ensure functions are only callable after  block.timestamp has passed, the  problem with the implementation is that the functions would be callable when deadline is exactly equal block.timestamp which is wrong.
## Impact
Wrong Implementation of Deadline as functions would be callable even at deadline

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It should revert when deadline is equal block.timestamp as edited below
```solidity
    modifier ensure(uint256 deadline) {
---        if (deadline < block.timestamp) revert Expired();
+++        if (deadline <= block.timestamp) revert Expired();
        _;
    }
```
